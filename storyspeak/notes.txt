Coherence ensures that the responses are logically connected to the conversation,
relevance ensures that the responses are appropriate to the user's input, and
diversity ensures that the responses are varied and interesting. By optimizing
for these three factors, the chatbot can provide high-quality, engaging responses
that are more likely to satisfy users and keep them engaged with the chatbot.
