Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence.\nCharacterised as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for classical music; he is particularly fond of Beethoven, referred to as \"Lovely Ludwig Van\".\nThe novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking \"milk-plus\"\u2014a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice\u2014to prepare for a night of mayhem.\nThey assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang.\nJoyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and raping his wife.\nIn a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called \"A Clockwork Orange\", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript.\nBack at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent.\nAt home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.\nAlex coyly feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day.\nFollowing an unexpected visit fromR.\nDeltoid, his \"post-corrective adviser\", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls.\nHe invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them.\nThe next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby.\nGeorgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a \"man-sized\" job.\nAlex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman.\nAlex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight.\nThe gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in their custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.\nAlex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day informed him that Georgie has been killed).\nTwo years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services.\nThe chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages.\nAfter his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted.\nThe technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence.\nAs an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.\nThe effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations.\nAlthough the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison.\nAlex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are renting his room to a lodger.\nNow homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide.\nThe old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends.\nTwo policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader.\nThey take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there.\nAlex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1.\nThe writer, Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape.\nHe does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone.\nAlexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected.\nAlex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers.\nHe attempts suicide by leaping from the window.\nAlex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt.\nWith Alexander placed in a mental institution, Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government.\nA round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning.\nAs photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, \"I was cured all right\".\nIn the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully).\nAfter a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence.\nHe begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children will be just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.\n"}

he is her fiftieth Cookie.\nHe is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire.\nInspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up.\nAs she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (\u201cEverybody Says Don't\u201d).\nAct three begins with Cora at her house with her council.\nSchub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it.\nThe group celebrates their alliance.\n(\u201cI've Got You to Lean On\u201d) A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock.\nDiscovering the fraud, Cora and the council confront them.\nAt that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached.\nSchub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled.\nFay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should.\nFay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading.\nAlthough she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone.\n(\u201cSee What it Gets You\u201d) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence.\n(\u201cThe Cookie Chase\u201d) As it ends, Fay is captured, and dr Detmold suddenly recognizes her.\nFay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her.\nDetmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory.\nCora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood.\nShe tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in.\nHe asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free.\nParting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared.\n(\u201cWith So Little to be Sure Of\u201d) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart.\nSoon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged.\nAgain, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar.\nCora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together.\nAs Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle.\nHorrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood.\nWhen he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle.\nHapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.\n' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time.\n(Finale).\n"}
{"prompt": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", "completion": " In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses.\nIn the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus.\nA slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom.\nOne of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\nOne day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero.\nHero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin).\nPseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom.\nUnfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior Miles Gloriosus, who is expected to claim her very soon.\nPseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a plague from Crete, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages.\nBy offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love.\nBut Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan\".\nTo appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it.\n\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives.\nPseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious.\nHe will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body.\nHero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece.\nSatisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door.\nPhilia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him.\nSurprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does.\nHysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired.\nPseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath.\nTaking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius.\nBut while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children.\nHysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath.\nErronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath.\nPseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her.\nDispleased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low\".\nShe disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful.\nPseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague.\nUnfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague.\nWith the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils).\nMeanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up.\nHis plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children.\nPhilia's betrothal to the Captain is obviously nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother.\nPhilia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children.\nA happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n"}

{"prompt": "Barry Lyndon", "completion": " An omniscient (though possibly unreliable) narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a duel over a sale of some horses.\nThe widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.\nAs a despondent young man, Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady.\nThough she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay.\nNora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until a fateful duel beside a river when Barry shoots Quin.\nIn the aftermath, Barry is urged to flee from incoming police and head through the countryside towards Dublin, but along the way he is robbed of purse, pistol, and horse by Captain Feeney, an infamous highwayman.\nDejected, Barry carries on to the next town, where he hears a promotional spiel to join the British Army, offering the chance at fame and glory (and a lifelong pension) in return for good service.\nBarry enlists.\nSome time after joining the regiment, Barry encounters Captain Grogan, a warm-hearted family friend.\nGrogan informs him that Barry did not in fact kill Quin, his dueling pistol having only been loaded with tow.\nThe duel was staged by Nora's family to be rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.\nBarry\u2019s regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the Seven Years' War, where Captain Grogan is fatally wounded by the French in a skirmish at the Battle of Minden.\nFed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers.\nEn route to neutral Holland he encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the Prussian Army.\nBarry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from Frederick the Great for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.\nTwo years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an expirate Irishman and professional gambler.\nThe Prussians suspect he is a spy and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this.\nBarry reveals himself to the Chevalier right away and they become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to his partner.\nAfter he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction.\nWhen Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince.\nSo, the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country.\nBarry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night.\nThe next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Captain Potzdorf and other Prussian officers.\nOver the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels.\nSeeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth.\nAt a gambling table in Spa, Belgium, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson).\nHe seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass).\nIn 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own.\nLord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a 'common opportunist' who does not truly love his mother.\nBarry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse.\nThe Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.\nSome years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate.\nShe warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless.\nBarry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself.\nTo further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society.\nAll this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon.\nA now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother.\nSeething with hatred, Barry savagely assaults Bullingdon until he is pulled off by the guests.\nThis loses Barry all the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked so hard to entreat and he is cast out of polite society.\nNevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England itself for parts unknown.\nIn contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure.\nHe cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday.\nThe spoiled Bryan disobeys his parents' direct instructions that Bryan ride the horse only in the presence of his father, is thrown by the horse, is paralyzed, and dies a few days later from his injuries.\nThe grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan.\nLeft in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition.\nPlunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself ill).\nThe Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon.\nUpon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon.\nBullingdon demands satisfaction for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.\nThe duel with pistols is held in a tithe barn.\nA coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot.\nBarry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously fires into the ground, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received \"satisfaction\".\nIn the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg.\nAt a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.\nWhile Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate.\nA few days later, Bullington sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an annuity of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return.\nOtherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed.\nDefeated in mind and body, Barry accepts.\nThe narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success).\nBarry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again.\nThe final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.\n"}

government has discovered Shadow vessels buried in Earth's solar system, begin to harness the vessels' advanced technology.\nThe Clark administration continues to become increasingly xenophobic and totalitarian, and gradually develops an Orwellian government style, including an organization called Night Watch which targets citizens who hold views contrary to those of Clark's regime.\nSheridan and Delenn's \"conspiracy of light\" works to uncover clues about how to defeat the Shadows.\nDuring a mission near Ganymede, one of the moons of Jupiter, their ship is seen by the Earth Alliance destroyer Agamemnon, but not recognized.\nThough they escape and no shots were fired in the encounter, President Clark uses it as an excuse to declare martial law.\nThis triggers a war of independence on Mars, which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth.\nBabylon 5 attempts to avoid conflict with Earth, but in response to civilian bombings on Mars, concerns with Night Watch, and illegal orders meant to oppress their populations, they choose to declare independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies including Orion VII and Proxima III.\nIn response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake Babylon 5 by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled at great cost.\nBecoming concerned over the Shadows' growing influence among his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them.\nmr Morden, the Shadows' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari's mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House.\nOpen warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari.\nIt is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of telepathy in humans and other races, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks.\nDispleased at the Vorlons' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador Kosh Naranek into launching an attack against their mutual enemy.\nKosh's deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.\nFormer station commander Jeffrey Sinclair returns to Babylon 5 to enlist the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus in stealing the Babylon 4 space station and sending it 1,000 years back in time to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the previous Minbari-Shadow war.\nHaving undergone a similar transformation to the one Delenn had at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than simply a reincarnation.\nMeanwhile, as a result of the unstable time travel, Sheridan sees a vision of the downfall of Centauri Prime when it is attacked by Shadow allies after the Shadow war, and he becomes determined to prevent that future.\nSheridan and Delenn begin a romantic relationship, but their lives and the war are interrupted by the sudden reappearance of Sheridan's wife, who was presumed dead after taking part in an archaeological expedition to Z'ha'dum years prior.\nShe tells Sheridan that the Shadows are not evil, hoping to bring him back with her and recruit him to their cause.\nHe soon realizes that her mind has been tampered with and corrupted by the Shadows, but accepts her offer to visit Z'ha'dum because he hopes it will save the galaxy sooner and prevent the downfall of Centauri Prime.\nHe takes with him a pair of nuclear warheads, which he uses to destroy their largest city, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.\nShadow vessels appear at the station, but disappear after Sheridan's attack.\nHowever, after they leave, station personnel realize that Garibaldi, who left in a fighter to defend against the vessels, never returned.\nIn 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been \"influenced\" by the Shadows.\nDisturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the First Ones) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons.\nCaptain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping from Z'ha'dum and reunites the galaxy against the Shadows, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live.\nHe is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the first sentient being in the galaxy, and who breathed life into Sheridan at Z'ha'dum.\nOnce Sheridan returns, he and Delenn formalize their relationship and begin planning to marry, although most of their plans are put on hold due to the ongoing war.\nHours before Sheridan's return, Garibaldi is rescued and returned to the station, in rather dubious circumstances.\nOver the course of the next several months, he becomes markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before, causing worry among his friends and colleagues.\nCentauri Emperor Cartagia forges a relationship with the Shadows.\nWith the reluctant help of his enemy G'Kar, Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows.\nIn exchange for G'Kar's help, Londo frees the Narn from Centauri occupation.\nLondo afterwards kills mr Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the Centauri homeworld, in a successful attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons.\nAided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the Vorlons and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless proxy wars throughout the ages.\nThe younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy in order to allow the younger races to find their own way.\nAfter the Shadows are defeated, Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a \"provider of information\".\nHe begins working for one William Edgars, a Mars tycoon, who is married to Garibaldi's former love.\nWhile he works ever closer with Edgars, he becomes increasingly aggressive toward Sheridan and eventually leaves Babylon 5.\nMinbar is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes.\nDelenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win.\nShe tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies.\nWhen Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior caste, in his heart he is Religious caste.\nAs part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi eventually betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture in order to gain Edgars' trust and learn his plans.\nGaribaldi later learns that Edgars had created a virus that is dangerous only to telepaths.\nIt is then revealed that after Garibaldi was captured the previous year, he was taken to the Psi Corps and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time.\nBester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he had done since being kidnapped.\nEdgars is killed by Psi Corps operatives.\nHis wife disappears but is reunited with Garibaldi after the end of the war.\nSheridan is tortured and interrogated by those who hope to break him and turn him into a propaganda tool for Earth's totalitarian government.\nFortunately, Garibaldi is able to help free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth.\nAn alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by president Clark in a short but bloody war.\nThis culminates in Clark's suicide and the restoration of democratic government in the Earth Alliance.\nMars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to resign his commission.\nThe League of Non-Aligned Worlds is dissolved and reformed into the Interstellar Alliance, with Sheridan elected as its first president and continuing his command of the Rangers, who are to act as a galactic equivalent of United Nations peacekeepers.\nLondo and G'Kar enter an uneasy alliance to help both their races as well as Sheridan in forming the Interstellar Alliance.\nDuring the final battle to liberate Earth from Clark's regime, Ivanova is critically injured, promised only a few days to live.\nMarcus, who had fallen in love with Ivanova, finds the same alien healing device used to revive Garibaldi at the beginning of the second season, and uses it to transfer almost all of his life energy into Ivanova, causing her to live.\nThis causes her immense emotional anguish, and she chooses to leave Babylon 5 for another posting in EarthForce.\nMarcus is placed into indefinite cryonic suspension at her request, pending resuscitation technology.\nSheridan and Delenn complete their marriage ceremony while en route to Babylon 5, where they will head the Interstellar Alliance until the completion of Alliance's permanent headquarters.\nIn the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5's lasting influence throughout history.\nAmong the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a pre-industrial society, the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's sun goes nova.\nIn 2262, Earthforce Captain Elizabeth Lochley is appointed to command Babylon 5, which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance.\nThe station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the Psi Corps, resulting in conflict.\nG'Kar, former Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, becomes unwillingly a spiritual icon after a book that he wrote while incarcerated during the Narn-Centauri War is published without his knowledge.\nThe Drakh, former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy, take control of Regent Virini on Centauri Prime through a parasitic creature called a Keeper, then incite a war between the Centauri and the Interstellar Alliance, in order to isolate the Centauri from the Alliance and gain a malleable homeworld for themselves.\nCentauri Prime is devastated by Narn and Drazi warships and Londo Mollari becomes emperor, then ends the war.\nHowever, the Drakh blackmail him into accepting a Drakh Keeper, under threat of the complete nuclear destruction of the planet.\nVir Cotto, Mollari's loyal and more moral aide, becomes ambassador to Babylon 5 in his stead.\nG'Kar also leaves Babylon 5 to escape his unwanted fame and explore the rim.\nSheridan and Delenn move to a city on Minbar, where the new headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance are located, while celebrating their first year of marriage and the upcoming birth of their son, and mourning the loss of dear friendships.\nGaribaldi marries and settles down on Mars, where he and his wife share ownership of a prominent pharmaceutical company.\nMost other main characters, including Stephen Franklin and Lyta Alexander, leave Babylon 5 as well.\nAs shown in flash-forwards earlier in the series, the next several years include the reign of Londo Mollari as Centauri Emperor.\nSixteen years later, Londo sacrifices his life to rescue Sheridan and Delenn from the Drakh, in the hope that they in turn can save Centauri Prime.\nTo prevent the Drakh from discovering his ruse, he asks G'Kar, now an old friend, to kill him, but Londo's Keeper wakes up and forces him to kill G'Kar in return.\nThey die at each other's throats, in accordance with Londo's vision many decades earlier, and Vir Cotto succeeds him as emperor, free of Drakh influence.\nThree years after Londo's death, Sheridan himself is on the verge of death and takes one last opportunity to gather his old friends together.\nShortly after his farewell party, Sheridan says goodbye to Delenn, though in Minbari fashion they use the word \"goodnight\" to signify their hope of an eventual reunion.\nSheridan then takes a final trip to the obsolete Babylon 5 station before its decommissioning.\nHe returns to the site of the final battle between the Vorlons and the Shadows and apparently dies, but is instead claimed by The First One, who invites him to join the other First Ones on a journey beyond the rim of the galaxy.\nBabylon 5 station is destroyed in a demolition shortly after Sheridan's departure, its existence no longer necessary as the Alliance has taken over its diplomatic purposes and other trading routes have been established.\nThis final episode features a cameo by Straczynski as the technician who switches off the lights before Babylon 5 is demolished.\n"}

abandoned and haunted.\nWhen they reach Willows House, they find it to be occupied and the current owner repeatedly denies them hospitality.\nOne of the hunters attempts to force his entry into the house, but a menacing giant (played by Tor Johnson) appears and scares the intruders away.\nInside a secret laboratory in the house, the owner observes a \"monster\": a giant octopus.\nThe \"monster\" is released from its tank and sent after the intruders.\nOne of the fleeing hunters is killed by the octopus, while the other is captured by the giant man.\nBack in the House, the captive is introduced to the owner and the giant.\nThe owner is a scientist, dr Eric Vornoff (Bela Lugosi), and the giant is his mute assistant, Lobo (Tor Johnson).\nVornoff explains that he is going to perform an experiment on the unwilling hunter that will either give the captive the strength of twenty men, or kill him.\nThe man dies on the operating table and the scientist is left visibly disheartened.\nIn a police station, officer Kelton (Paul Marco) asks to work the case of the monster of Lake Marsh.\nHis superior Tom Robbins (Harvey Dunn), turns him down and instead asks to see lieutenant Dick Craig (Tony McCoy, producer Donald McCoy's son).\nThe conversation between Robbins and Craig establishes that there are now 12 missing victims, and the police still has yet to determine what happened to them.\nThe reporter behind the newspaper reports is Janet Lawton (Loretta King Hadler) who happens to be Craig's fianc\u00e9e.\nJanet forces her way into the office and joins the conversation.\nRobbins and Janet argue, and Janet states that she is going to Lake Marsh to personally investigate the place and leaves the station.\nIn the offices of the newspaper where Janet works, Janet visits the archives of the newspaper, asking the librarian Tillie (Ann Wilner) permission to research Willows House.\nThen she leaves the offices.\nAt the police station, Robbins and Craig have a meeting with an intellectual from Europe, Professor Vladimir Strowski (George Becwar).\nHe claims that there are significant similarities between the case of the Monster of Lake Marsh and that of the Loch Ness Monster.\nHe agrees to assist the police in investigating the Marsh, but not at night.\nAs night falls and another storm begins, Janet drives alone to Lake Marsh.\nDue to poor visibility, Janet drives her car off the road and into a ravine.\nShe leaves the car, and is immediately threatened by a large snake.\nAs she passes out from fear, Lobo wrestles with the snake to rescue her.\nIn a brief scene, Lobo caresses and smells the beret of Janet.\nJanet wakes up to find herself a prisoner of Vornoff, who uses hypnosis to put her back to sleep.\nThe following day, Craig and his partner drive to the area around Lake Marsh.\nThe scene reveals that the area is a swamp.\nThe partners also discuss the strange weather, and mention that the newspapers could be right about \"the atom bomb explosions distorting the atmosphere\".\nAnother bit of dialogue points that Strowski left on his own, missing his scheduled appointment with the police.\nThe duo eventually discovers Janet's abandoned car and realize she is the 13th missing victim.\nThey leave the swamp to rush to \"a coffee joint about ten miles back\".\nMeanwhile, Strowski drives a rented car to the swamp.\nThrough the phone of the coffeehouse, Craig and his partner alert Robbins about Janet's disappearance.\nThe Captain starts researching her movements and contacts prior to the disappearance.\nIn Willows House, Janet awakens.\nVornoff and Lobo are there to greet her and offer tea.\nVornoff assures her that Lobo is harmless, but the giant seems fascinated with her and approaches the female captive with questionable intent.\nVornoff resorts to belting his assistant to drive him away, revealing to Janet the violent and despotic nature of her host.\nVornoff offers a brief background explanation for Lobo, mentioning that the giant is just human and that Vornoff found him in the \"wilderness of Tibet\".\nVornoff abruptly ends the conversation by hypnotically placing Janet back to sleep.\nHe orders Lobo to transport the captive to Votnoff's private quarters.\nMeanwhile, Strowski silently approaches Willows House and enters through the unlocked front door.\nWhile Strowski searches the house, Vornoff arrives to greet him.\nThey are revealed to be old acquaintances.\nTheir (unspecified) country of origin is interested in Vornoff's groundbreaking experiments with atomic energy and wants to recruit him.\nVornoff narrates that two decades prior to the events of the film, Vornoff had suggested using experiments with nuclear power which could create superhumans of great strength and size.\nIn response, he was branded a madman and exiled by his country.\nStrowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country, while Vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name.\nHe has no loyalty to the country which exiled him.\nRealizing this, Strowski attacks Vornoff, but Lobo appears to defend Vornoff, and they best Strowski.\nBy late evening, Craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover Strowski's abandoned car.\nThe partners part ways in their search of the area, with Craig heading towards Willows House.\nBack in the secret laboratory, Vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon Janet to his current location.\nShe arrives dressed as a bride, summoned through telepathy.\nHe has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments.\nLobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment, and Vornoff uses a whip to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant.\nMeanwhile, Craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage.\nHe is himself captured by Vornoff and Lobo.\nAs the experiment is about to begin, the camera shifts to Lobo, who is visibly distressed.\nThe viewer is introduced to the inner struggle of the mute giant.\nHe is torn between his loyalty to Vornoff and his infatuation with Janet.\nTaking his decision, Lobo rebels and attacks Vornoff.\nAfter a fight, Lobo knocks Vornoff out, releases Janet, and transports the unconscious Vornoff to the operating table.\nThe scientist becomes the subject of his own human experiment.\nJanet releases Craig, who briefly and ineffectually attempts to stop Lobo.\nCraig is once again defeated and knocked out.\nThis time the experiment works and Vornoff is transformed to an atomic-powered superhuman being.\nHe and Lobo physically struggle with each other, and this time Vornoff emerges the victor.\nTheir fight destroys the laboratory and starts a fire.\nVornoff grabs Janet and escapes from the flames.\nRobbins and other officers arrive to help Craig.\nThe police pursue Vornoff through the woods.\nThere is another thunderstorm, and a lightning strike further destroys Willows House.\nWith his home and equipment destroyed, a distressed Vornoff abandons Janet and merely attempts to escape.\nCraig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus.\nThe struggles

{"prompt": "Chrono Trigger", "completion": " Chrono Trigger takes place in a world familiar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive.\nThe characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest.\nThe party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year \u221e), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods.\nThe party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch.\nThe vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.\nChrono Trigger's six playable characters (plus one optional character) come from different eras of history.\nChrono Trigger begins in AD 1000 with Crono, Marle and Lucca.\nCrono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a katana in battle.\nMarle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity.\nLucca is a friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery.\nFrom the era of AD 2300 comes Robo, or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans.\nLying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude.\nThe fiercely confident Ayla dwells in 65,000,000 BC.\nUnmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid reptiles known as Reptites.\nThe last two playable characters are Frog and Magus.\nFrog originated in AD 600.\nHe is a former squire once named Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus.\nChivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus.\nMeanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer.\nMagus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC.\nThe incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala.\nLavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.\nIn AD 1000, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new teleporter at the Millennial Fair.\nWhen Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn.\nAfter Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in AD 600, they find Marle only to see her vanish before their eyes.\nLucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle for an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a grandfather paradox.\nCrono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped queen.\nAfter the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia.\nLucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers.\nThis portal lands them in AD 2300, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999.\nThe three vow to find a way to prevent the future destruction of their world.\nAfter meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light.\nTheir party expands to include Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword.\nThey return to AD 600 to challenge Magus, believing him to be the source of Lavos; after the battle, a summoning spell causes a time gate that throws Crono and his friends to the past.\nIn prehistory, the group battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos.\nThey learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb DNA and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 so that it could spawn a new generation.\nIn 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine.\nHowever Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal imprisons Crono and friends.\nThough Zeal's daughter Schala frees them, the Prophet, a mysterious figure who has recently begun advising the queen, forces her to banish them from the realm and seal the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages.\nThey return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or Epoch), which can access any time period without using a time gate.\nThey travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace.\nLavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the Prophet reveals himself to be Magus and tries to kill the creature.\nCrono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast, after which Lavos destroys the Kingdom of Zeal.\nCrono's friends awake in a village and find Magus, who confesses that he used to be prince Janus of Zeal.\nIn his memories, it is revealed that the disaster at the Ocean Palace scattered the Gurus of Zeal across time and sent him to the Middle Ages.\nJanus took the alias of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala, but when Lavos appeared after his battle with Crono and his allies he was cast back to the time of Zeal and presented himself to them as a prophet.\nAs Crono's friends depart, the Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen.\nThe group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a \"Chrono Trigger,\" an egg-shaped device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a Dopple Doll.\nCrono and his friends then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions.\nTheir journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics, stopping Robo's maniacal AI creator, addressing Frog's feelings towards Cyrus, locating and charging up the mythical Sun Stone, retrieving the Rainbow Shell, and helping restore a forest destroyed by a desert monster.\nThe group enters the Black Omen and defeats Queen Zeal, then successfully battles Lavos, saving the future of their world.\nIf Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala.\nCrono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.\nAlternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons.\nCrono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth.\nHanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.\nChrono Trigger DS added two new scenarios to the game.\nIn the first, Crono and his friends can help a \"lost sanctum\" of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor.\nThe second scenario adds ties to Trigger's sequel, Chrono Cross.\nIn a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia.\nThe group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer\u2014a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross.\nA version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away.\nSchala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.\n"}

approaching it healed Serge but corrupted his father.\nA circuit in Chronopolis then designated Serge \"Arbiter\", simultaneously preventing FATE from using the Frozen Flame by extension.\nThe Dragons were aware of this situation, creating a seventh Dragon under the storm's cover named Harle, who manipulated Lynx to steal the Frozen Flame for the Dragons.\nAfter Serge returned home, FATE sent Lynx to kill Serge, hoping that it would release the Arbiter lock.\nTen years after Serge drowned, the thief Kid\u2014presumably on Belthasar's orders\u2014went back in time to save Serge and split the dimensions.\nFATE, locked out of the Frozen Flame again, knew that Serge would one day cross to Another world and prepared to apprehend him.\nLynx switched bodies with Serge to dupe the biological check of Chronopolis on the Frozen Flame.\nBelthasar then reveals that these events were part of a plan he had orchestrated named Project Kid.\nSerge continues to the top of Terra Tower and defeats the Dragon God.\nContinuing to the beach where the split in dimensions had occurred, Serge finds apparitions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca once more.\nThey reveal that Belthasar's plan was to empower Serge to free Schala from melding with Lavos, lest they evolve into the \"Time Devourer\", a creature capable of destroying spacetime.\nLucca explains that Kid is Schala's clone, sent to the modern age to take part in Project Kid.\nSerge uses a Time Egg\u2014given to him by Belthasar\u2014to enter the Darkness Beyond Time and vanquish the Time Devourer, separating Schala from Lavos and restores the dimensions to one.\nThankful, Schala muses on evolution and the struggle of life and returns Serge to his home, noting that he will forget the entire adventure.\nShe then seemingly records the experience in her diary, noting she will always be searching for Serge in this life and beyond, signing the entry as Schala \"Kid\" Zeal, implying that she and kid have merged and became whole again.\nA wedding photo of Kid and an obscured male sits on the diary's desk.\nScenes then depict a real-life Kid searching for someone in a modern city, intending to make players entertain the possibility that their own Kid is searching for them.\nThe ambiguous ending leaves the events of the characters' lives following the game up to interpretation.\nChrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, and themes from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger released in Japan.\nAn illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers was created to wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger.\nThough it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross is not a remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable.\nTo resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension.\nA notable difference between the two games is that Magus\u2014present in Radical Dreamers as Gil\u2014is absent from Chrono Cross.\nDirector Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties.\nIn the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.\n"}

however, the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives.\nWhen the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel, a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula, with a warning about \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\".\nA small section was removed from a draft of the final chapter, in which Dracula's castle falls apart as he dies, hiding the fact that vampires were ever there.\n"}

{"prompt": "Dune Messiah", "completion": " Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965), Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides rules as Emperor.\nBy accepting the role of messiah to the Fremen, Paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe.\nWhile Paul is the most powerful emperor ever known, he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created.\nAlthough 61 billion people have perished, Paul's prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity.\nMotivated by this knowledge, Paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction, while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the Fremen religion.\nThe Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone Paul, and the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam enlists Paul's own consort Princess Irulan, daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\nPaul has refused to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her), but his Fremen concubine Chani has also failed to produce an heir, causing tension within his monarchy.\nDesperate both to secure her place in the Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to Chani.\nPaul is aware of this fact, but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death, and does not want to lose her.\nHe sees this in a terrifying vision of a moon that falls from the sky of Dune.\nBecause of the way oracles interfere with one another's prescience, the Guild Navigator Edric is able to shield the conspiracy from Paul's visions of the future.\nThe Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he cannot resist: a Tleilaxu-grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho, Paul's childhood teacher and friend, now called \"Hayt\".\nThe conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created.\nFurthermore, Paul's acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the Fremen, who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean.\nChani, taking matters into her own hands, switches to a traditional Fremen fertility diet, preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her food, and soon becomes pregnant.\nOtheym, one of Paul's former Fedaykin death commandos, reveals evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against Paul.\nOtheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz, who like a recording machine, can remember faces, names, and details.\nPaul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot.\nAs Paul's soldiers attack the conspirators, others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner, purchased from the Tleilaxu, that destroys the area and blinds Paul.\nBy tradition, all blind Fremen are abandoned in the desert, but Paul shocks the Fremen and entrenches his godhood by proving he can still see, even without eyes.\nHis oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens, as though his eyes still function.\nBy moving through his life in lockstep with his visions, he can see even the slightest details of the world around him.\nThe disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny, trapping him in a hellish boredom.\nThe unraveling of the Fremen conspiracy reveals that Korba, a former Fedaykin and now high priest of Paul's church, is among Paul's enemies.\nDuncan interrogates Bijaz, but the little man\u2014actually an agent of the Tleilaxu\u2014uses a specific humming intonation that renders Duncan open to implanted commands.\nBijaz programs Duncan to offer Paul a bargain when Chani dies: Chani's rebirth as a ghola, and the hope that Duncan Idaho's memories might be reawakened, in return for Paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile.\nBijaz also implants a compulsion that will force Duncan to attempt to kill Paul, given the appropriate circumstances.\nDuncan remains oblivious of the programming.\nEventually, news is brought that Chani has died giving birth.\nThe grief of his loss is the falling moon that he foresaw in an earlier vision, and Paul stumbles, truly blind now, having removed himself from the prison of his own precise vision.\nPaul's reaction to his wife's death triggers the compulsions in the mind of Duncan, who attempts to kill Paul.\nRather than kill his beloved Paul, though, Duncan's ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan's full consciousness.\nHe remains conscious of the Zen-Sunni and Mentat training given to Duncan by the Tleilaxu, but is no longer bound to their programming.\nPaul and Chani's newborn twins are \"pre-born\", like Paul's sister Alia had been, and come into the world fully conscious with Kwisatz Haderach-like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in Chani's special pregnancy diet.\nScytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for all of Paul's CHOAM holdings.\nPaul refuses to submit to the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in some diabolical way, and Scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with Alia.\nBy successfully escaping the oracular trap and setting the universe on a new path, Paul has been rendered completely blind, yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger due to a vision from his son's perspective.\nNow prophetically and physically blind, Paul chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert, winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children, who will inherit his mantle of emperor.\nPaul leaves Alia, now romantically involved with Duncan, as regent for the twins, whom he has named Leto and Ghanima.\nDuncan notes the irony that Paul and Chani's deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies, and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man, while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line.\n"}

{"prompt": "Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford", "completion": " De Vere had sold his inherited lands in Cornwall, Staffordshire and Wiltshire prior to his continental tour.\nOn his return to England in 1576 he sold his manors in Devonshire; by the end of 1578 he had sold at least seven more.\nIn 1577 De Vere invested \u00a325 in the second of Martin Frobisher's expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage.\nIn July 1577 he asked the Crown for the grant of Castle Rising, which had been forfeited to the Crown due to his cousin Norfolk's attainder in 1572.\nAs soon as it was granted to him, he sold it, along with two other manors, and sank some \u00a33,000 into Frobisher's third expedition.\nThe 'gold' ore brought back turned out to be worthless, and De Vere lost the entire investment.\nIn the summer of 1578 De Vere attended the Queen's progress through East Anglia.\nThe royal party stayed at Lord Henry Howard's residence at Audley End.\nA contretemps occurred during the progress in mid-August when the Queen twice requested De Vere to dance before the French ambassadors, who were in England to negotiate a marriage between the 46-year-old Elizabeth and the younger brother of Henri III of France, the 24-year-old Duke of Anjou.\nDe Vere refused on the grounds that he \"would not give pleasure to Frenchmen\".\nIn April the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, wrote to King Philip II of Spain that it had been proposed that if Anjou were to travel to England to negotiate his marriage to the Queen, De Vere, Surrey and Windsor should be hostages for his safe return.\nAnjou himself did not arrive in England until the end of August, but his ambassadors were already in England.\nDe Vere was sympathetic to the proposed marriage, Leicester and his nephew Philip Sidney were adamantly opposed to it.\nThis antagonism may have triggered the famous quarrel between De Vere and Sidney on the tennis court at Whitehall.\nIt is not entirely clear who was playing on the court when the fight erupted; what is undisputed is that De Vere called Sidney a 'puppy', while Sidney responded that \"all the world knows puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men\".\nThe French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display.\nWhether it was Sidney who next challenged De Vere to a duel or the other way around, De Vere did not take it further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and De Vere's.\nChristopher Hatton and Sidney's friend Hubert Languet also tried to dissuade Sidney from pursuing the matter, and it was eventually dropped.\nThe specific cause is not known, but in January 1580 De Vere wrote and challenged Sidney; by the end of the month De Vere was confined to his chambers, and was not released until early February.\nDe Vere openly quarrelled with the Earl of Leicester about this time; he was confined to his chamber at Greenwich for some time 'about the libelling between him and my Lord of Leicester'.\nIn the summer of 1580, Gabriel Harvey, apparently motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with Leicester, satirized De Vere's love for things Italian in verses entitled Speculum Tuscanismi in Three Proper and Witty Familiar Letters.\nAlthough details are unclear, there is evidence that in 1577 De Vere attempted to leave England to see service in the French Wars of Religion on the side of King Henry III.\nLike many members of older established aristocratic families in England, De Vere inclined to Catholicism; after his return from Italy he was reported to have embraced the religion, perhaps after being introduced to a seminary priest, Richard Stephens, by a distant kinsman, Charles Arundell.\nBut just as quickly, late in 1580 he denounced a group of Catholics, among them Arundell, Francis Southwell and Henry Howard, for treasonous activities and asking the Queen's mercy for his own, now repudiated, Catholicism.\nElizabeth characteristically delayed in acting on the matter and he was detained under house arrest for a short time.\nLeicester is credited for having \"dislodged De Vere from the pro-French group\",e, the group at court which favoured Elizabeth's marriage to the Duke of Anjou.\nThe Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, was also of the view that Leicester was behind De Vere's informing on his fellow Catholics in an attempt to prevent the French marriage.\nPeck concurs, stating that Leicester was \"intent upon rendering Sussex's allies politically useless\".\nThe Privy Council ordered the arrest of both Howard and Arundell; De Vere immediately met secretly with Arundell to convince him to support his allegations against Howard and Southwell, offering him money and a pardon from the Queen.\nArundell refused De Vere's offer, and he and Howard initially sought asylum with Mendoza.\nOnly after being assured they would be placed under house arrest in the home of a Privy Council member, did the pair give themselves up.\nDuring the first weeks after their arrest they pursued a threefold strategy: they would admit to minor crimes, prove De Vere a liar by his offers of money to testify to his accusations, and demonstrate that their accuser posed the real danger to the Crown.\nThe extensive list to discredit De Vere included atheism, lying, heresy, disobedience to the crown, treason, murder for hire, sexual perversion and pederasty with his English and Italian servants (\"buggering a boy that is his cook and many other boys\"), habitual drunkenness, vowing to murder various courtiers and declaring that Elizabeth had a bad singing voice.\nArundell and Howard cleared themselves of De Vere's accusations, although Howard remained under house arrest into August, while Arundell was not freed until October or November.\nNone of the three was ever indicted or tried.\nIn the meantime De Vere was at liberty, and won a tournament at Westminster on 22 January.\nHis page's speech at the tournament, describing De Vere's appearance as the Knight of the Tree of the Sun, was published in 1592 in a pamphlet entitled Plato, Axiochus.\nOn 14 April 1589 De Vere was among the peers who found Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, the eldest son and heir of De Vere's cousin, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, guilty of treason.\nArundel later died in prison.\nDe Vere later insisted that \"the Howards were the most treacherous race under heaven\" and that \"my Lord Howard [was] the worst villain that lived in this earth\".\nDuring the early 1580s it is likely that the Earl lived mainly at one of his Essex country houses, Wivenhoe, which was sold in 1584.\nIn June 1580 he purchased a tenement and seven acres of land near Aldgate in London from the Italian merchant Benedict Spinola for \u00a32,500.\nThe property, located in the parish of St Botolphs, was known as the Great Garden of Christchurch and had formerly belonged to Magdalene College, Cambridge.\nHe also purchased a London residence, a mansion in Bishopsgate known as Fisher's Folly.\nAccording to Henry Howard, De Vere paid a large sum for the property and renovations to it.\nDe Vere's triumph was short-lived.\nOn 23 March 1581 Sir Francis Walsingham advised the Earl of Huntingdon that two days earlier Anne Vavasour, one of the Queen's maids of honour, had given birth to a son, and that \"the Earl of Oxford is avowed to be the father, who hath withdrawn himself with intent, as it is thought, to pass the seas\".\nDe Vere was captured and imprisoned in the Tower, as was Anne and her infant, who would later be known as Sir Edward Vere.\nBurghley interceded for him, and he was released from the Tower on 8 June, but he remained under house arrest until sometime in July.\nWhile De Vere was under house arrest in May, Thomas Stocker dedicated to him his Divers Sermons of Master John Calvin, stating in the dedication that he had been \"brought up in your Lordship's father's house\".\nDe Vere was still under house arrest in mid-July, but took part in an Accession Day tournament at Whitehall on 17 November 1581.\nDe Vere was banished from court until June 1583.\nHe appealed to Burghley to intervene with the Queen on his behalf, but his father-in-law repeatedly put the matter in the hands of Sir Christopher Hatton.\nAt Christmas 1581 De Vere reconciled with his wife, Anne, but his affair with Anne Vavasour continued to have repercussions.\nIn March 1582 there was a skirmish in the streets of London between De Vere and Anne's uncle, Sir Thomas Knyvet.\nDe Vere was wounded and his servant killed; reports conflict as to whether Kynvet was also injured.\nThere was another fray between Knyvet's and De Vere's retinues on 18 June, and a third six days later, where it was reported that Knyvet had \"slain a man of the Earl of Oxford's in fight\".\nIn a letter to Burghley three years later De Vere offered to attend his father-in-law at his house \"as well as a lame man might\"; it is possible his lameness was a result of injuries from that encounter.\nOn 19 January 1585 Anne Vavasour's brother Thomas sent De Vere a written challenge; it appears to have been ignored.\nMeanwhile, the street-brawling between factions continued.\nAnother of De Vere's men was slain that month, and in March Burghley wrote to Sir Christopher Hatton about the death of one of Knyvet's men, thanking Hatton for his efforts \"to bring some good end to these troublesome matters betwixt my Lord and Oxford and Mr Thomas Knyvet\".\nOn 6 May 1583, eighteen months after their reconciliation, Edward and Anne's only son was born, and died the same day.\nThe infant was buried at Castle Hedingham three days later.\nAfter intervention by Burghley and Sir Walter Raleigh, De Vere was reconciled to the Queen and his two-year exile from court ended at the end of May on condition of his guarantee of good behaviour.\nHowever, he never regained his position as a courtier of the first magnitude.\n"}

outlawed books.\nHe is married and has no children.\nOne fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness.\nMontag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention.\nMildred survives with no memory of what happened.\nOver the next days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home.\nShe tells him about how her interests have made her an outcast at school.\nMontag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes absent.\nHe senses something is wrong.\nIn the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice.\nThe woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive.\nMontag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide.\nWhile getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow.\nStill shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, conversation that only causes him to realize how little he knows her and how little they have in common.\nMontag asks his wife if she has seen Clarisse recently.\nMildred mutters that she believes Clarisse died after getting struck by a speeding car and that her family has moved away.\nDismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep.\nOutside he suspects the presence of \"The Hound\", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.\nMontag awakens ill the next morning and stays home from work.\nHe relates the story of the burned woman to an apathetic Mildred and mentions perhaps quitting his work.\nThe possibility of becoming destitute from the loss of income provokes a strong reaction from her, and she says the woman herself was to blame because she had books.\nCaptain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing.\nSensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media, sports, and a quickening pace of life.\nBooks were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in books.\nThe government took advantage of this, and the firemen were soon hired to burn books in the name of public happiness.\nBeatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.\nAfter Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that over the last year he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct.\nIn a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator; Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value.\nIf they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.\nWhile Montag and Mildred are perusing the stolen books, a sniffing occurs at their front door.\nMontag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes it off as a random dog.\nThey resume their discussion once the sound ceases.\nMontag laments Mildred's suicide attempt, the woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying over their house taking part in a looming war neither he, nor anybody else, knows much about.\nHe states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction.\nThe conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, mrs Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the \"parlor walls\" (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.\nMontag, meanwhile, concedes that he will need help to understand the books.\nMontag remembers an old man named Faber he once met in a park a year ago, an English professor before books were banned.\nHe telephones Faber with questions about books, and Faber soon hangs up on him.\nUndeterred, Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house.\nMontag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible.\nFaber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.\nAfter Montag returns home, Mildred's friends, mrs Bowles and mrs Phelps, arrive to watch the \"parlor walls\".\nNot interested in this insipid entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only to find them indifferent to all but the most trivial aspects of the upcoming war, friends' deaths, their families, and politics.\nMontag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry.\nThis confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely.\nMontag proceeds to recite the poem Dover Beach, causing mrs Phelps to cry.\nAt the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book.\nMildred's friends leave in disgust, while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom and takes more sleeping pills.\nIn the aftermath of the parlor party, Montag hides his books in his backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible.\nHe finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen.\nMontag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash.\nBeatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other.\nIn describing the dream Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader.\nA fire alarm sounds, and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system.\nThey drive in the firetruck recklessly to the destination.\nMontag is stunned when the truck arrives at his house.\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him it was Mildred and her friends who reported him.\nMontag tries to talk to Mildred as she quickly leaves the house.\nShe ignores him, gets into a taxi, and vanishes down the street.\nMontag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower.\nAs soon as he has incinerated the house, Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber.\nMontag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious.\nAs Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse's mechanical dog attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer.\nHe destroys The Hound with the flamethrower and limps away.\nMontag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house.\nFaber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled book-lovers who live there.\nHe mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to st Louis and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later.\nOn Faber's television, they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle.\nMontag leaves Faber's house.\nAfter an extended manhunt, he escapes by wading into a river and floating downstream.\nMontag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, led by a man named Granger.\nThey have each memorized books for an upcoming time when society is ready to rediscover them.\nWhile learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and attack the city with nuclear weapons, completely annihilating it.\nWhile Faber would have left on the early bus, Mildred along with everyone else in the city was surely killed.\nMontag and the group are injured and dirtied, but manage to survive the shock wave.\nThe following morning, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth.\nHe adds that the phoenix must have

{"prompt": "Fearless (1993 film)", "completion": " While taking a business trip, architect Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) survives a crash of a flight headed from San Francisco to Houston.\nAs the plane descends, Max inexplicably becomes at peace when he accepts he is going to die.\nThe revelation inspires him to comfort many of the fearful passengers, even moving to sit next to Byron Hummel (Daniel Cerny), a young boy flying alone.\nThe psychological trauma of the experience transforms his personality and he enters an altered state of consciousness, rethinking his life and becoming preoccupied with the eternal meanings and the existential questions of life and death itself.\nMax's reaction to this awakening itself questions the reality of what is real and unreal and what his mind perceives as real through his interaction with others and the chance of living again in everyday life.\nImmediately after the crash, Max, one of the plane's few survivors, rents a car and drives from the crash site in Bakersfield to Los Angeles, stopping on the way to visit his old high school sweetheart, Alison (Debra Monk), whom he hasn't seen in 20 years.\nDuring their meal at a restaurant Alison notices Max eating a strawberry and inquires about his allergy to them.\nMax grins and explains he's \"gotten past\" his allergic reaction and somehow, confidently finishes it with no problems.\nHe's tracked down at a hotel room the next morning byBI.\nagents who question his odd choice to not contact his wife and family or remain at the crash site with the other survivors.\nThe airline sends a representative who compensates him with train tickets to go home to San Francisco.\nMax declines the tickets, stating adamantly that he wants to fly home and has no fear of air travel anymore.\nOn the flight he meets dr Bill Perlman (John Turturro), an airline-contracted psychiatrist who offers to counsel Max for post-traumatic stress disorder.\ndr Perlman accompanies Max back to his home where his wife Laura (Isabella Rossellini) begins noticing his strange behavior.\nMax matter-of-factly tells Nan Gordon (Deirdre O'Connell), the wife of his friend and business partner, that her husband Jeff (John de Lancie) died in the crash.\nThe media dubs Max \"The Good Samaritan\" and tries to interview him as Byron comes to publicly thank him for the way he comforted the passengers during the crash, but Max avoids making a statement.\nOver time Max becomes distant from Laura and his son Jonah (Spencer Vrooman) because of his preoccupation with his near death experience.\nHe begins drawing abstract pictures of the crash and his sense of a hole opening in the sky before him.\nHe comes to think of himself as invulnerable to death causing dr Perlman to become concerned that Max is delusional.\nPerlman encourages Max to meet with another survivor, Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), in the hope that the two can help support one another.\nCarla, who lost her baby son in the crash, struggles with survivor's guilt, punishing herself for not holding onto him tightly enough when his seat belt on the plane malfunctioned.\nMax and Carla bond and develop a close friendship as he helps her to get past her depression and free herself from her guilt.\nMax, Laura and Nan meet with attorney Steven Brillstein (Tom Hulce), who encourages Max to exaggerate his testimony in order to increase Nan's compensation settlement offer from the airline.\nMax states his discomfort with lying but reluctantly agrees when he considers Nan's financial predicament as a widow.\nThe unease of lying causes Max to have a panic attack and he runs out of the office to the roof of the building where he climbs onto the ledge.\nAs Max stands on the ledge, looking down at the streets below, his panic attack subsides and he rejoices in his fearlessness.\nLaura follows Max onto the roof and upon finding him, blindly spinning around on the ledge with his overcoat billowing across his face, she believes him to be suicidal.\nEventually Max's increasingly dramatic attempts (culminating with an intentional car crash into a brick wall) at pushing the boundaries between life and death succeed in jolting Carla from her uncertain state.\nAfterwards, Carla meets with Laura and the two clarify the misunderstanding that she and Max are past a co-dependency state and are in fact, in love with each other.\nMoreover, Carla explains that she regards Max as he sees himself - an angel - and Laura now understands their shared delusion.\nHowever, after Carla reluctantly parts company with Max, he remains aloof in his relationship with his wife and son, struggling to come to terms with his implied immortality.\nOne night, Brillstein arrives at the Klein home to celebrate the pending settlement offer, and brings a basket with an assortment of fruits.\nMax eats one of the strawberries but, unlike at the restaurant, this time he experiences an immediate allergic reaction and suffocates.\nAs he lies choking, Max goes into a state of vision where he sees various flashbacks and starts toward the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel (in the guise of an aisle in the airplane fuselage) as Laura's voice is overheard repeatedly \"calling him back\" to the world.\nMax accepts the reality of his imminent death when suddenly he's resuscitated by Laura.\nHe survives and (it's implied) recovers his emotional connection to his family, to the world and to the reality of yet another chance at life.\n"}
{"prompt": "Formant", "completion": " The first two formants are important in determining the quality of vowels, and are frequently said to correspond to the open/close and front/back dimensions (which have traditionally, though not entirely accurately, been associated with the shape and position of the tongue).\nThus the first formant F has a higher frequency for an open vowel (such as ) and a lower frequency for a close vowel (such as or ); and the second formant F has a higher frequency for a front vowel (such as ) and a lower frequency for a back vowel (such as ).\nas can be seen in Fig.\n1.\nVowels will almost always have four or more distinguishable formants; sometimes there are more than six.\nHowever, the first two formants are most important in determining vowel quality, and this is often displayed in terms of a plot of the first formant against the second formant, though this is not sufficient to capture some aspects of vowel quality, such as rounding.\nAn example of how the vowels of a language or dialect may be plotted on a traditional auditory vowel chart and also on a formant plot may be seen in the case of Norwegian.\nMany writers have addressed the problem of finding an optimal alignment of the positions of vowels on formant plots with those on the conventional vowel quadrilateral.\nThe pioneering work of Ladefoged used the Mel scale because this scale was claimed to correspond more closely to the auditory scale of pitch than to the acoustic measure of fundamental frequency expressed in Hertz as in Fig.\n1.\nTwo alternatives to the Mel scale are the Bark scale and the ERB-rate scale.\nA comparison of these three scales is shown by Hayward,&nbsp;141, and formant plots based on the Hertz scale and on the Bark scale are compared on&nbsp;153.\nAnother strategy for improving formant plots that has been widely adopted is to plot on the horizontal axis not the value of F2 but the difference between F1 and F2 for a given vowel.\n"}

{"prompt": "Fawlty Towers", "completion": " The series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, as well as their employees, porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and, in the second series, chef Terry.\nThe episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in \"raising the tone\" of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so.\nMuch of the humor comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as \"that golfing puff adder\", \"my little piranha fish\" and \"my little nest of vipers\".\nDespite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of \"Basil.\n\" At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.\nBasil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music.\nIn one episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: \"You could have them both done by now if you hadn't spend the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket\".\nBasil replies, with exasperation, \"Racket.\nThat's Brahms.\nBrahms' Third Racket.\n\"  The plots occasionally are intricate and always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental.\nThe innuendo of the bedroom farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots.\nThe events test to the breaking point what little patience Basil has, sometimes causing him to have a near breakdown by the end of the episode.\nThe guests at the hotel typically are comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts.\nEach episode's one-shot guest characters provide a different characteristic that he cannot stand, among them being promiscuous, working class or foreign.\nRequests both reasonable and impossible test his temper.\nEven the afflicted seem to annoy him.\nFor example, the episode \"Communication Problems\" revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing mrs Richards.\nBy the end, Basil faints just at the mention of her name.\nThis episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk.\nThe show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil (\"Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife.\nAwfully good.\nI saw it six times\".\n) and to the guests (\"May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea.\nOr preferably in it\".\n).\nBasil's physical outbursts are primarily directed at the waiter Manuel, an emotional but largely innocent Spaniard whose confused English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes.\nAt times, Basil beats Manuel with a frying pan and smacks his forehead with a spoon.\nThe violence towards Manuel caused rare negative criticism of the show.\nSybil, on the other hand, is always condescending toward Manuel, excusing his behavior to guests with \"He's from Barcelona\".\nBasil often displays blatant snobbishness as he attempts to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the \"riff-raff\", \"cretins\" and \"yobbos\" that he believes to regularly populate his hotel.\nHis desperation is readily apparent as he makes increasingly hopeless maneuvers and painful faux pas in trying to curry favor with those he perceives as having superior social status.\nYet, he finds himself forced to serve those individuals that are \"beneath\" him.\nAs such, Basil's efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching to breaking point.\n"}

{"prompt": "Guy Fawkes", "completion": " In 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate the Protestant King James and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth.\nFawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend Oswald Tesimond as \"pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife&nbsp;.\nloyal to his friends\".\nTesimond also claimed Fawkes was \"a man highly skilled in matters of war\", and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism which endeared him to his fellow conspirators.\nThe author Antonia Fraser describes Fawkes as \"a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard\", and that he was \"a man of action&nbsp;.\ncapable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies\".\nThe first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable Strand district of London.\nCatesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with Thomas Wintour and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up \"the Parliament House with gunpowder\".\nWintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help.\nWintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain.\nOwen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country.\nWintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help.\nWintour told Fawkes of their plan to \"doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott\", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England.\nWintour's news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that \"the deeds would nott answere\".\nOne of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe.\nFawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy.\nThe contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel.\nIf the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.\nThey ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.\nFawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.\nThe plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard.\nUnused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store.\nAccording to Fawkes, 20&nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&nbsp;more on 20 July.\nOn 28 July however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.\nIn an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters' plan.\nAt some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who employed a network of spies across Europe.\nOne of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible.\nAlthough the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England.\nFawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to \"Mr Catesby\" and \"honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness\".\nTurner's report did not, however, mention Fawkes's pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.\nMore gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.\nFawkes's final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October.\nHe was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames.\nSimultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.\nActs of regicide were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to the continent, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.\nA few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening.\nOn the evening of 26 October, Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to \"retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for&nbsp;.\nthey shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament\".\nDespite quickly becoming aware of the letterinformed by one of Monteagle's servantsthe conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it \"was clearly thought to be a hoax\".\nFawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed.\nMonteagle's suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James.\nThe King ordered Sir Thomas Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November.\nFawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy \"becaus he should knowe howe the time went away\".\nHe was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested.\nInside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.\nFawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the King's Privy chamber, where he remained defiant.\nWhen asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was \"to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains\".\nHe identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson.\nWounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of pleurisy.\nFawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so.\nHis steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\nJames's admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that \"John Johnson\" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators.\nHe directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of manacles, but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of the rack: \"the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]\".\nFawkes was transferred to the Tower of London.\nThe King composed a list of questions to be put to \"Johnson\", such as \"as to what he is, For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him\", \"When and where he learned to speak French.\n\", and \"If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it.\n\" The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.\nSir William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes's confession.\nHe searched his prisoner, and found a letter, addressed to Guy Fawkes.\nTo Waad's surprise, \"Johnson\" remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors.\nOn the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury \"He [Johnson] told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul\".\nAccording to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until \"I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices\".\nHis composure was broken at some point during the following day.\nThe observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked \"Since Johnson's being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English\".\nFawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the King.\nHe began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne.\nHis third confession, on 9 November, implicated Francis Tresham.\nFollowing the Ridolfi plot of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could.\nAlthough it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes's scrawled signature bears testament to the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.\nThe trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606.\nFawkes shared the barge from the Tower to Westminster Hall with seven of his co-conspirators.\nThey were kept in the Star Chamber before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold.\nThe King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges.\nFawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, \"otherwise called Guido Johnson\".\nHe pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.\nThe outcome was never in doubt.\nThe jury found all the defendants guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham found them guilty of high treason.\nThe Attorney General Sir Edward Coke told the court that each of the condemned would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground.\nThey were to be \"put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both\".\nTheir genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed.\nThey would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become \"prey for the fowls of the air\".\nFawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot.\nThe last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells.\nThe two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy.\nWhen the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.\nOn 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others&nbsp;\u2013 Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood, and Robert Keyes&nbsp;\u2013 were dragged (ie.\ndrawn) from the Tower on wattled hurdles to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy.\nHis fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered.\nFawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold.\nHe asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his \"crosses and idle ceremonies\" (Catholic practices).\nWeakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck.\nHis lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to \"the four corners of the kingdom\", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.\n"}

Reconstruction Era (1865\u20131877).\nThe novel unfolds against the backdrop of rebellion wherein seven southern states initially, Georgia among them, have declared their secession from the United States (the \"Union\") and formed the Confederate States of America (the \"Confederacy\"), after Abraham Lincoln was elected president.\nThe Union refuses to accept secession and no compromise is found as war approaches.\nThe novel opens in April 1861 at \"Tara,\" a plantation owned by Gerald O'Hara, an Irish immigrant who has become a successful planter, and his wife, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a coastal aristocratic family of French descent.\nTheir 16-year-old daughter, Scarlett, is not beautiful, but men seldom realized it once they were caught up in her charm.\nIt was the day before the men were called to war, Fort Sumter having been fired on two days earlier.\nThere are brief but vivid descriptions of the South as it began and grew, with backgrounds of the main characters: the stylish and highbrow French, the gentlemanly English, the forced-to-flee and looked-down-upon Irish.\nScarlett learns that one of her many beaux, Ashley Wilkes, will soon be engaged to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton.\nShe is heart-stricken.\nThe next day at the Wilkeses' barbecue at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett tells Ashley she loves him, and he admits he cares for her.\nHowever, he knows he would not

dandy.\nAlthough Rhett believes the war is a lost cause, he is blockade running for profit.\nThe men must bid for a dance with a lady, and Rhett bids \"one hundred fifty dollars-in gold\" for a dance with Scarlett.\nThey waltz to the tune of \"When This Cruel War is Over,\" and Scarlett sings the words.\nOthers at the dance were shocked that Rhett would bid for a widow and that she would accept

Rhett has a change of heart and abandons Scarlett to enlist in the army (he later recounts that when they learned he had attended West Point, they put him in the artillery, which may have saved his life).\nScarlett then makes her way to Tara, where she is welcomed on the steps by her father, Gerald.\nThings have drastically changed: Scarlett's mother is dead, her father has lost his mind with

office.\nIn their conversation, she comes away believing Ashley still loves her and is jealous of her intimate relations with Rhett, which excites her.\nShe returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more children.\nFrom then on, they sleep separately, and when Bonnie is two years old, she sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett (with the light on all night because she is afraid of the dark).\nRhett turns his attention toward Bonnie, dotes on her, spoils her, and worries about her reputation when she is older.\nMelanie is giving a surprise birthday party for Ashley.\nScarlett goes to the mill to keep Ashley there until party time, a rare opportunity for her to see him alone.\nWhen she sees him, she feels \"sixteen again, a little breathless and excited\".\nAshley tells her how

from the party long after Scarlett.\nHis eyes are bloodshot, and his mood is dark and violent.\nHe enjoins Scarlett to drink with him.\nNot wanting him to know she is fearful of him, she throws back a drink and gets up from her chair to go back to her bedroom.\nHe stops her and pins her shoulders to the wall.\nShe tells him he is jealous of Ashley, and Rhett accuses her of \"crying for the moon\" over Ashley.\nHe tells her they could have been happy together saying, \"for I loved you and I know you\".\nHe then takes her in his arms and carries her up the stairs to her bedroom, where it is

her finger and giving into her every demand.\nEven Scarlett is jealous of the attention Bonnie gets.\nRhett rides his horse around town with Bonnie in front of him, but Mammy insists it is not fitting for a girl to ride a horse with her dress flying up.\nRhett heeds her words and buys Bonnie a Shetland pony, whom she names \"Mr.\nButler,\" and teaches her to ride sidesaddle.\nThen Rhett pays a boy named Wash twenty-five cents to teach mr Butler to jump over wood bars.\nWhen mr Butler is able to get his fat legs over a one-foot bar, Rhett puts Bonnie on the pony, and soon mr Butler is leaping bars and Aunt Melly's rose bushes.\nWearing her blue velvet riding habit with a red feather in her black hat, Bonnie pleads with her father to raise the bar to one and a half feet.\nHe gives in, warning her not to come crying if she falls.\nBonnie yells to her mother, \"Watch me take this one.\n\" The pony gallops towards the wood bar, but trips over it.\nBonnie breaks her neck in the fall, and dies.\nIn the dark days and months following Bonnie's death, Rhett is often drunk and disheveled, while Scarlett, though deeply bereaved also, seems to hold up under the strain.\nWith the untimely

love that has eluded her for so long.\nHowever, she still has Tara and knows she can win Rhett back, because \"tomorrow is another day\".\n"}

Brandon notes it could either destroy all matter in the universe or rewind time by 13 seconds, \"enough time to undo one mistake\".\nHaving finally accepted their roles on the ship and gained confidence in themselves, Nesmith and his crew use the minefield as a weapon against Sarris' ship, destroying it.\nThey prepare to head to Earth when Sarris, who has transported over at the last moment, starts killing the crew.\nA desperate Nesmith activates the Omega 13, which reverses time far enough for him to knock out Sarris.\nThey near a wormhole to return the humans home via the command module, and Nesmith assures Mathesar he has the ability to command the Protector along with the other Thermians.\nThe humans, along with Laliari (Pyle), a Thermian that has fallen in love with Kwan, return home.\nGuided in by fireworks set by Brandon and his friends, the command module makes a crash landing near a fan convention and comes to a stop after bursting through one wall, which the audience takes as part of the show.\nAs the crew exits the module, Sarris wakes up and tries to fire on them, but Nesmith reacts faster, and disintegrates Sarris with a phaser-like weapon.\nThe crowd believes this to also be part of the show erupts into cheers.\nThe buzz from the event leads Galaxy Quest to be revived as a new series, starring the same cast along with Fleegman and Laliari.\n"}

scene turns to the streets of a city, with the narrator commenting that each human has his/her own thoughts, ideas, and personality.\nHe makes further comments on human life, while sounds accompany some comments.\nThe cries of a newborn baby are followed by the sirens of an ambulance.\nOne is a sign that a new life has begun, the other that a life has ended.\nThis last comment starts the narrative of the film.\nThe life which has ended is that of a transvestite named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed suicide.\nA scene opens with his/her corpse in a small room.\nWithin the room is an unidentified man who opens the door to a physician, a photographer, and the police.\nA suicide note explains the reasons behind the suicide.\nPatrick/Patricia had been arrested four times for cross-dressing in public, and had spent time in prison.\nSince he/she would continue wearing women's clothing, subsequent arrests and imprisonment were only a matter of time.\nSo he/she ended his/her

are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive and comfortable clothing.\nThe narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a homosexual.\nHe hides his cross-dressing from his fianc\u00e9e, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him.\nAlton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding, or waiting until after.\nThe narrative shifts briefly from Glen's story to how society reacts to sex change operations.\nA conversation between two \"average joes\", concludes that society should be more \"lenient\" when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies.\nThe story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.\nLater,

comments \"Beware.\nBeware.\nBeware of the big, green dragon that sits on your doorstep.\nHe eats little boys, puppy dog tails, and big, fat snails.\nTake care.\nBeware.\n\" This serves as the

{"prompt": "Gunpowder Plot", "completion": " The conspirators' principal aim was to kill King James, but many other important targets would also be present at the State Opening, including the monarch's nearest relatives and members of the Privy Council.\nThe senior judges of the English legal system, most of the Protestant aristocracy, and the bishops of the Church of England would all have attended in their capacity as members of the House of Lords, along with the members of the House of Commons.\nAnother important objective was the kidnapping of the King's daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth.\nHoused at Coombe Abbey near Coventry, the Princess lived only ten miles north of Warwick\u2014convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the Midlands.\nOnce the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.\nThe fate of Princes Henry and Charles would be improvised; their role in state ceremonies was, as yet, uncertain.\nThe plotters planned to use Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, as Elizabeth's Protector, but most likely never informed him of this.\nRobert Catesby (1573\u20131605), a man of \"ancient, historic and distinguished lineage\", was the inspiration behind the plot.\nHe was described by contemporaries as \"a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman\".\nAlong with several other conspirators, he took part in the Earl of Essex's rebellion in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured.\nQueen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000&nbsp;marks (equivalent to more than \u00a36&nbsp;million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in Chastleton.\nIn 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, Philip III, urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics.\nThomas Wintour (1571\u20131606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James.\nWintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that \"3,000 Catholics\" were ready and waiting to support such an invasion.\nConcern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.\nAccording to contemporary accounts, in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in Lambeth, where they discussed Catesby's plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.\nWintour was known as a competent scholar, able to speak several languages, and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands.\nHis uncle, Francis Ingleby, had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586, and Wintour later converted to Catholicism.\nAlso present at the meeting was John Wright, a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day, and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex's rebellion three years earlier.\nDespite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail, Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy, perhaps persuaded by Catesby's rhetoric: \"Let us give the attempt and where it faileth, pass no further\".\nWintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support.\nWhile there he sought out Guy Fawkes (1570\u20131606), a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley, and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy.\nAccompanied by John Wright's brother Christopher, Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England.\nWintour told Fawkes that \"some good frends of his wished his company in Ingland\", and that certain gentlemen \"were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott\".\nThe two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely.\nThomas Percy, Catesby's friend and John Wright's brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later.\nPercy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596 was his agent for the family's northern estates.\nAbout 1600\u20131601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries.\nAt some point during Northumberland's command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James.\nPercy was reputedly a \"serious\" character who had converted to the Catholic faith.\nHis early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on \"his sword and personal courage\".\nNorthumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth.\nThomas Percy's meetings with James seemed to go well.\nPercy returned with promises of support for the Catholics, and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.\nPercy, keen to improve his standing, went further, claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.\nThe first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20&nbsp;May 1604, probably at the Duck and Drake Inn, just off the Strand, Thomas Wintour's usual residence when staying in London.\nCatesby, Thomas Wintour, and John Wright were in attendance, joined by Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy.\nAlone in a private room, the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book.\nBy coincidence, and ignorant of the plot, Father John Gerard (a friend of Catesby's) was celebrating Mass in another room, and the five men subsequently received the Eucharist.\nFollowing their oath, the plotters left London and returned to their homes.\nThe adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.\nOn 9&nbsp;June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, a mounted troop of 50&nbsp;bodyguards to the King.\nThis role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.\nPercy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, Dudley Carleton and John Hippisley.\nFawkes, using the pseudonym \"John Johnson\", took charge of the building, posing as Percy's servant.\nThe building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby's lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night.\nMeanwhile, King James continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7&nbsp;July.\nThe conspirators returned to London in October 1604, when Robert Keyes, a \"desperate man, ruined and indebted\", was admitted to the group.\nHis responsibility was to take charge of Catesby's house in Lambeth, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored.\nKeyes's family had notable connections; his wife's employer was the Catholic Lord Mordaunt.\nTall, with a red beard, he was seen as trustworthy and, like Fawkes, capable of looking after himself.\nIn December Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it.\nIt was announced on 24&nbsp;December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed.\nConcern over the plague meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3&nbsp;October 1605.\nThe contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.\nThis may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.\nThe account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.\nLogistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.\nIf the story is true, by 6&nbsp;December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.\nThey ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.\nThe noise turned out to be the then-tenant's widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords\u2014the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.\nBy the time the plotters reconvened at the start of the old style new year on Lady Day, 25&nbsp;March, three more had been admitted to their ranks; Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Christopher Wright.\nThe additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices.\nAlong with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited Huddington Court (a known refuge for priests) near Worcester, and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man.\nA devout Catholic, he married Gertrude Talbot, who was from a family of recusants.\nChristopher Wright (1568\u20131605), John's brother, had also taken part in the Earl of Essex's revolt and had moved his family to Twigmore in Lincolnshire, then known as something of a haven for priests.\nJohn Grant was married to Wintour's sister, Dorothy, and was lord of the manor of Norbrook near Stratford-upon-Avon.\nReputed to be an intelligent, thoughtful man, he sheltered Catholics at his home at Snitterfield, and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601.\nIn addition, 25&nbsp;March was the day on which the plotters purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near to, owned by John Whynniard.\nThe Palace of Westminster in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.\nThe old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops, and taverns within its precincts.\nWhynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the River Thames.\nUndercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood.\nWhynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen.\nUnused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.\nIn the second week of June Catesby met in London the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, and asked him about the morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent, together with the guilty.\nGarnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion.\nSoon after, the Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession, in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.\nGarnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24&nbsp;July 1605, at the house of the wealthy catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase.\nGarnet decided that Tesimond's account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard.\nWithout acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail.\nGarnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England.\nHe also told Acquaviva that \"there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King\", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.\nAccording to Fawkes, 20&nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&nbsp;more on 20&nbsp;July.\nThe supply of gunpowder was theoretically controlled by the government, but it was easily obtained from illicit sources.\nOn 28&nbsp;July, the ever-present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament, this time until Tuesday 5&nbsp;November.\nFawkes left the country for a short time.\nThe King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.\nHe stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.\nGarnet, convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded, travelled the country on a pilgrimage.\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.\nMore gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.\nThe final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605.\nAt Michaelmas, Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon.\nRookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment.\nHis parents, Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury, were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais.\nEverard Digby was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire.\nHe had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.\nDigby and his wife, Mary Mulshaw, had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.\nDigby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester.\nDigby also promised \u00a31,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster.\nFinally, on 14&nbsp;October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy.\nTresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham, and a cousin to Robert Catesby\u2014the two had been raised together.\nHe was also the heir to his father's large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby's involvement in the Essex revolt.\nCatesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law and cousin, Lord Stourton.\nIn his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done.\nCatesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire.\nTresham declined both offers (although he did give \u00a3100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.\nThe details of the plot were finalised in October, in a series of taverns across London and Daventry.\nFawkes would be left to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.\nFawkes would leave for the continent, to explain events in England to the European Catholic powers.\nThe wives of those involved and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen.\nSeveral of the conspirators expressed worries about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion.\nPercy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel's name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day.\nThe Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle, and Stourton were also mentioned.\nKeyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer, to derision from Catesby.\nOn Saturday 26&nbsp;October, Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton.\nHaving broken the seal, he handed the letter to a servant who read it aloud:  Uncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle promptly rode to Whitehall and handed it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury).\nSalisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected papist Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days.\nMonteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal.\nCatesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator.\nTresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot.\nSalisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved.\nHe therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.\nThe letter was shown to the King on Friday 1 November following his arrival back in London.\nUpon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word \"blow\" and felt that it hinted at \"some strategem of fire and powder\", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, at Kirk o' Field in 1567.\nKeen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance.\nThe following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\".\nOn Sunday 3&nbsp;November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should \"abide the uttermost triall\", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames.\nBy 4&nbsp;November Digby was ensconced with a \"hunting party\" at Dunchurch, ready to abduct Princess Elizabeth.\nThe same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland\u2014who was uninvolved in the conspiracy\u2014to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle.\nPercy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray's Inn Road.\nThat same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands.\nFawkes visited Keyes, and was given a pocket watch left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler.\nAlthough two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4&nbsp;November\u2014as the plotters were busy making their final preparations\u2014by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard.\nThey found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy.\nThey left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building.\nThe mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator.\nThe King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken.\nLate that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft.\nThey again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs.\nHe was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson.\nHe was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and touchwood.\n36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal.\nFawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5&nbsp;November.\nAs news of \"John Johnson's\" arrest spread among the plotters still in London, most fled northwest, along Watling Street.\nChristopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together.\nRookwood left soon after, and managed to cover 30&nbsp;miles in two hours on one horse.\nHe overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill, before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road.\nReunited, the group continued northwest to Dunchurch, using horses provided by Digby.\nKeyes went to Mordaunt's house at Drayton.\nMeanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster to see what was happening.\nWhen he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister's house at Norbrook, before continuing to Huddington Court.\nThe group of six conspirators stopped at Ashby St Ledgers at about 6&nbsp;pm, where they met Robert Wintour and updated him on their situation.\nThey then continued on to Dunchurch, and met with Digby.\nCatesby convinced him that despite the plot's failure, an armed struggle was still a real possibility.\nHe announced to Digby's \"hunting party\" that the King and Salisbury were dead, before the fugitives moved west to Warwick.\nIn London, news of the plot was spreading, and the authorities set extra guards on the city gates, closed the ports, and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador, which was surrounded by an angry mob.\nAn arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy, and his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, was placed under house arrest.\nIn \"John Johnson's\" initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother, and that he was from Yorkshire.\nA letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person, but he claimed that name was one of his aliases.\nFar from denying his intentions, \"Johnson\" stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament.\nNevertheless, he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone.\nHis unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\nOn 6 November, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Popham (a man with a deep-seated hatred of Catholics) questioned Rookwood's servants.\nBy the evening he had learned the names of several of those involved in the conspiracy: Catesby, Rookwood, Keyes, Wynter , John and Christopher Wright, and Grant.\n\"Johnson\" meanwhile persisted with his story, and along with the gunpowder he was found with, was moved to the Tower of London, where the King had decided that \"Johnson\" would be tortured.\nThe use of torture was forbidden, except by royal prerogative or a body such as the Privy Council or Star Chamber.\nIn a letter of 6&nbsp;November James wrote: \"The gentler tortours [tortures] are to be first used unto him, et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur [and thus by steps extended to greater ones], and so God speed your good work\".\n\"Johnson\" may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall, but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the rack.\nOn 7&nbsp;November his resolve was broken; he confessed late that day, and again over the following two days.\nOn 6&nbsp;November, with Fawkes maintaining his silence, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons.\nFrom there they continued their journey to Huddington.\nBates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.\nGarnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing.\nSeveral priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.\nThey were caught, and then imprisoned in London.\nCatesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.\nThey received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason.\nThey continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers.\nTired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out.\nAlthough gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).\nThomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died.\nAt that point, Littleton left, but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive, albeit scorched.\nJohn Grant was not so lucky, and had been blinded by the fire.\nDigby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left.\nOf the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, and the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy, remained.\nThe fugitives resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the King's men.\nRichard Walsh (Sheriff of Worcestershire) and his company of 200&nbsp;men besieged Holbeche House on the morning of 8&nbsp;November.\nThomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder while crossing the courtyard.\nJohn Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood.\nCatesby and Percy were reportedly killed by a single lucky shot.\nThe attackers rushed the property, and stripped the dead or dying defenders of their clothing.\nGrant, Morgan, Rookwood, and Wintour were arrested.\n"}

{"prompt": "Heart of Darkness", "completion": " Aboard the Nellie, anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend, England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an ivory trading company.\nAs a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\" (Conrad 10).\nYet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\" (Conrad 10).\nThe image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\" (Conrad 10).\nFeeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18).\nAfter more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river.\nMarlow, still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede.\nHe departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company's station is.\nWork on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives.\nMarlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24-25).\nMarlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck\" (Conrad 26).\nMarlow has to wait for ten days in the Company's Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut.\nAt this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a mr Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\" (Conrad 28).\nThe agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long.\nThey, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\" (Conrad 29).\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based.\nOn the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier.\nHe meets the General Manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumors had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional mr Kurtz, was ill.\n\"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks irritated (Conrad 34).\nHe fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives.\nWhile one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks.\nMarlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after.\nHanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\" (Conrad 39).\nMarlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that mr Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago.\nThe brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39).\nThe man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\" (Conrad 39-40).\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station.\nDuring this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).\nOnce underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months to the day.\nThe steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\nThe journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station.\nIn the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog.\nFrom the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour.\nA few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest.\nThe helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet.\nMarlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease.\nMarlow and a pilgrim watch the helmsman die.\nIn a flash forward, Marlow notes that the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently.\nA handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes.\n\" (Conrad 83).\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land.\nThe pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve mr Kurtz.\nThe man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp.\nHe explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut.\nThrough conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late.\nThe Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet.\nHe tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it.\nMarlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives.\nAround the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher.\nThe area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest.\nThe pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation.\nMarlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer.\nWhen the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\".\nLater, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore.\nHe goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help.\nMarlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region.\nThe next day they prepare for their journey back down the river.\nThe natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly.\nNoticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives.\nOnly the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms.\nThe pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill.\nThe steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager.\nWhen Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: \"The horror.\nThe horror.\n\" (Conrad 116).\nA short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" (Conrad 117).\nThe next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117).\nHe falls very ill, himself near death.\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world.\nMany callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in.\nHe then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit.\nFinally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\" (Conrad 79).\nWhen Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death.\nShe presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words, which in fact are \"The horror.\nThe horror.\n\" Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n"}

the Bene Tleilax, who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of Face Dancers; and the Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities.\nHowever, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers.\nThe most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.\nOn Rakis, a girl called Sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms.\nThe Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu-provided Duncan Idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider, and the religious forces of humanity who they know will ultimately worship her.\nThe Tleilaxu have altered the ghola to bring its physical reflexes up to modern standards.\nThe Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior Taraza, brings Miles Teg to guard the new Idaho.\nTaraza also sends Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis.\nOdrade is a loose cannon;

she finds appeal in Urquhart's much older age and later refers to him as \"Daddy\".\nAnother unwitting pawn is Roger O'Neill (Miles Anderson), the party's cocaine-addicted public relations consultant.\nUrquhart blackmails O'Neill into leaking information on budget cuts that humiliates Collingridge during the Prime Minister's Questions.\nLater, he blames party chairman Lord \"Teddy\" Billsborough (Nicholas Selby) for leaking an internal poll showing a drop in Tory numbers, leading Collingridge to sack him.\nAs Collingridge's image suffers, Urquhart encourages ultraconservative Foreign Secretary Patrick Woolton (Malcolm Tierney) and Chronicle owner Benjamin Landless to support his removal.\nUrquhart also poses as Collingridge's alcoholic brother, Charles, to trade shares in a chemical company about to benefit from advance information confidential to the government.\nConsequently, Collingridge becomes falsely accused of insider trading and is forced to resign.\nIn the ensuing leadership race, Urquhart initially feigns unwillingness to stand before announcing his candidacy.\nWith the help of his underling, Tim Stamper (Colin Jeavons), Urquhart goes about making sure his competitors drop out of the race: Health Secretary Peter MacKenzie (Christopher Owen) accidentally runs his car over a disabled protester at a demonstration staged by Urquhart and is forced by the public outcry to withdraw, while Education Secretary Harold Earle (Kenneth Gilbert) is blackmailed into withdrawing when Urquhart anonymously sends pictures of him in the company of a rent boy whom Earle had paid for sex.\nThe first ballot leaves Urquhart to face Woolton and Michael Samuels, the moderate Environment Secretary supported by Billsborough.\nUrquhart eliminates Woolton by a prolonged scheme: at the party conference, he pressures O'Neill into persuading his personal assistant and lover, Penny Guy (Alphonsia Emmanuel), to have a one-night stand with Woolton in his suite, which Urquhart records via a bugged ministerial red box.\nWhen the tape is sent to Woolton, he is led to assume that Samuels is behind the scheme and backs Urquhart in the contest.\nUrquhart also receives support from Collingridge, who is unaware of Urquhart's role in his own downfall.\nSamuels is forced out of the running when the tabloids reveal that he backed leftist causes as a student at University of Cambridge.\nStumbling across contradictions in the allegations against Collingridge and his brother, Mattie begins to dig deeper.\nOn Urquhart's orders, O'Neill arranges for her car and flat to be vandalised in a show of intimidation.\nHowever, O'Neill becomes increasingly uneasy with what he is being asked to do, and his cocaine addiction adds to his instability.\nUrquhart mixes O'Neill's cocaine with rat poison, causing him to kill himself when taking the cocaine in a motorway lavatory.\nThough initially blind to the truth of matters thanks to her relations with Urquhart, Mattie eventually deduces that Urquhart is responsible for O'Neill's death and is behind the unfortunate downfalls of Collingridge and all of Urquhart's rivals.\nMattie looks for Urquhart at the point when it seems his victory is certain.\nShe eventually finds him on the roof garden of the Houses of Parliament, where she confronts him.\nHe admits to O'Neill's murder and everything else he has done.\nHe then asks whether he can trust Mattie, and, though she answers in the affirmative, he does not believe her and throws her off the roof onto a van parked below.\nAn unseen person picks up Mattie's tape recorder, which she had been using to secretly record her conversations with Urquhart.\nThe series ends with Urquhart defeating Samuels in the second leadership ballot and being driven to Buckingham Palace to be invited to form a government by Elizabeth II.\n"}

however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.\nPap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the Illinois shoreline.\nBecause of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off down river.\nHe settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island.\nHere, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave.\nJim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him \"down the river\" to presumably more brutal owners.\nJim plans to make his way to the town of Cairo in Illinois, a free state, so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom.\nAt first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian.\nAfter heavy flooding on the river, the two find a raft (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river.\nEntering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back.\nHe prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.\nTo find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area.\nHuck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt.\nmrs Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests.\nOnce he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing.\nHuck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night.\nThe two hastily load up the raft and depart.\nAfter a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamship.\nSearching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed.\nThey are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident.\nJim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly.\nHuck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.\nTravelling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two.\nHuck is given shelter on the Kentucky side of the river by the Grangerfords, an \"aristocratic\" family.\nHe befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family, the Shepherdsons.\nThe Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love.\nThe vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan.\nIn the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses.\nHe is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.\nNear the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run grifters aboard the raft.\nThe younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater).\nThe older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the Lost Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France.\nThe \"duke\" and \"king\" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey.\nTo divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the \"Sick Arab\" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.\nOn one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called \"The Royal Nonesuch\".\nThe play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham.\nOn the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done.\nBy the third night of \"The Royal Nonesuch\", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.\nIn the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property.\nTo match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke pretends to be a deaf-mute, while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance.\nHuck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance.\nIn a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning.\nThe arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again.\nSuddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair.\nWhen Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward.\nDefying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions\u2014\"All right, then, I'll go to hell.\n\"\u2014Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.\nHuck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of Silas and Sally Phelps.\nThe family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home.\nHe plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that the expected nephew is in fact Tom Sawyer.\nWhen Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, Sid, while Huck continues pretending to be Tom.\nIn the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for \"The Royal Nonesuch\", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.\nRather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme.\nDuring the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone.\nAlthough a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps.\nAfter this, events quickly resolve themselves.\nTom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family.\nJim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim.\nJim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to st Petersburg.\nHuck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.\n"}
{"prompt": "Ivanhoe", "completion": " Ivanhoe is the story of one of the remaining Saxon noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly Norman.\nIt follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart.\nThe story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe.\nKing Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.\nThe legendary Robin Hood, initially under the name of Locksley, is also a character in the story, as are his \"merry men\".\nThe character that Scott gave to Robin Hood in Ivanhoe helped shape the modern notion of this figure as a cheery noble outlaw.\nOther major characters include Ivanhoe's intractable father, Cedric, one of the few remaining Saxon lords; various Knights Templar, most notable of whom is Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Ivanhoe's main rival; a number of clergymen; the loyal serfs: Gurth the swineherd and the jester Wamba, whose observations punctuate much of the action; and the Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York, who is equally passionate about his people and his beautiful daughter, Rebecca.\nThe book was written and published during a period of increasing struggle for the emancipation of the Jews in England, and there are frequent references to injustices against them.\nProtagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, Cedric's ward and a descendant of the Saxon Kings of England, after Cedric planned to marry her to the powerful Lord Athelstane, a pretender to the Crown of England through his descent from the last Saxon King, Harold Godwinson.\nIvanhoe accompanies King Richard on the Crusades, where he is said to have played a notable role in the Siege of Acre; and tends to Louis of Thuringia, who suffers from malaria.\nThe book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates seeking the hospitality of Cedric.\nThey are guided there by a pilgrim, known at that time as a palmer, (one who carried blessed palms leaves such as those that were scattered at the feet of Jesus Christ by residents of Jerusalem when he entered seated on an donkey's colt on the Sunday before his arrest, trial and crucifixion; hence the name Palm Sunday).\nAlso returning from the Holy Land that same night, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood.\nFollowing the night's meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to his Saracen soldiers to capture Isaac.\nThe palmer then assists in Isaac's escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of the swineherd Gurth.\nIsaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and a war horse to participate in the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch Castle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight.\nThe palmer is taken by surprise; but accepts the offer.\nThe story then moves to the scene of the tournament, presided over by Prince John.\nOther characters in attendance are Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca, Robin of Locksley and his men, Prince John's advisor Waldemar Fitzurse, and numerous Norman knights.\nOn the first day of the tournament, a bout of individual jousting, a mysterious knight, identifying himself only as \"Desdichado\" (described in the book as Spanish for the \"Disinherited\", though actually meaning \"Unfortunate\"), defeats some of the best Norman competitors, including Bois-Guilbert, Maurice de Bracy (a leader of a group of \"Free Companions\"), and the baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.\nThe masked knight declines to reveal himself despite Prince John's request, but is nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose the Queen of the Tournament.\nHe bestows this honour upon the Lady Rowena.\nOn the second day, at a melee, Desdichado is the leader of one party, opposed by his former adversaries.\nDesdichado's side is soon hard pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes, until rescued by a knight nicknamed 'Le Noir Faineant' (\"the Black Sluggard\"), who thereafter departs in secret.\nWhen forced to unmask himself to receive his coronet (the sign of championship), Desdichado is identified as Wilfred of Ivanhoe, returned from the Crusades.\nThis causes much consternation to Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King Richard.\nBecause he is severely wounded in the competition, Ivanhoe is taken into the care of Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac, who is a skilled healer.\nShe convinces her father to take him with them to York, where he can be best treated.\nThe story then glosses the conclusion of the tournament including feats of archery by Locksley.\nIn the forests between Ashby and York, the Lady Rowena, Cedric and Athelstane acquire Isaac, Rebecca and the wounded Ivanhoe, who have been abandoned by their servants for fear of bandits.\nEn route, the party is captured by de Bracy and his companions and taken to Torquilstone, the castle of Front-de-Boeuf.\nThe swineherd Gurth, who had served Ivanhoe as squire at the tournament and who was recaptured by Cedric when Ivanhoe was identified, manages to escape.\nThe Black Knight, having taken refuge for the night in the hut of a local friar, the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, volunteers his assistance on learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley.\nThey then besiege the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin's own men, including the friar and assorted Saxon yeomen.\nAt Torquilstone, de Bracy expresses his love for the Lady Rowena, but is refused.\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert tries to seduce Rebecca, and is rebuffed.\nFront-de-Boeuf tries to wring a hefty ransom from Isaac of York; but Isaac refuses to pay unless his daughter is freed.\nWhen the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives, their Norman captors demand a priest to administer the Final Sacrament to Cedric; whereupon Cedric's jester Wamba slips in disguised as a priest, and takes the place of Cedric, who then escapes and brings important information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its layout.\nThe besiegers then storm the castle.\nThe castle is set aflame during the assault by Ulrica, the daughter of the original lord of the castle, Lord Torquilstone, as revenge for her father's death.\nFront-de-Boeuf is killed in the fire while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight, who identifies himself as King Richard and releases de Bracy.\nBois-Guilbert escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is rescued by the Clerk of Copmanhurst.\nThe Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric, while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is rescued from the burning castle by King Richard.\nIn the fighting, Athelstane is wounded and presumed dead while attempting to rescue Rebecca, whom he mistakes for Rowena.\nFollowing the battle, Locksley plays host to King Richard.\nWord is also conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King's return and the fall of Torquilstone.\nIn the meantime, Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive to the nearest Templar Preceptory, where Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand-Master of the Templars, takes umbrage at Bois-Guilbert's infatuation, and subjects Rebecca to a trial for witchcraft.\nAt Bois-Guilbert's secret request, she claims the right to trial by combat; and Bois-Guilbert, who had hoped for the position, is devastated when the Grand-Master orders him to fight against Rebecca's champion.\nRebecca then writes to her father to procure a champion for her.\nCedric organises Athelstane's funeral at Coningsburgh, in the midst of which the Black Knight arrives with a companion.\nCedric, who had not been present at Locksley's carousal, is ill-disposed towards the knight upon learning his true identity; but Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him with his son.\nDuring this conversation, Athelstane emerges \u2013 not dead, but laid in his coffin alive by monks desirous of the funeral money.\nOver Cedric's renewed protests, Athelstane pledges his homage to the Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to marry Rowena to Ivanhoe; to which Cedric finally agrees.\nSoon after this reconciliation, Ivanhoe receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca's behalf.\nAccordingly, Ivanhoe overcomes Bois-Guilbert but does not kill him, and the Templar dies of internal causes which is pronounced by the Grand Master as the judgement of God and proof of Rebecca's innocence.\nFearing further persecution, Rebecca and her father leave England for Granada.\nBefore leaving, Rebecca comes to bid Rowena a fond farewell.\nFinally, Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together, though the final paragraphs of the book note that Ivanhoe's military service ended with the death of King Richard.\n"}
{"prompt": "Into the Woods", "completion": " Starting with the words \"Once Upon a Time,\" the Narrator introduces four characters who each have a wish: Cinderella, the daughter of a wealthy man who has been reduced by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters into becoming their skivvy, wishes to attend the King's festival; Jack, a simple poor boy, wishes that his cow, Milky White, would give milk; and a Baker and his Wife wish they could have a child.\nWhile Little Red Ridinghood wishes for bread from the Baker to take to her grandmother's house, which they reluctantly give, Jack's weary mother, who wishes for gold, nags him into selling the cow, and Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters Florinda and Lucinda tease her about wanting to attend the King's festival.\nThe Baker's neighbor, an ugly old witch, reveals that the source of the couple's infertility is a curse she placed on the Baker's line after catching the Baker's father in her garden stealing vegetables, including six \"magic\" beans.\nIn addition to the curse, the Witch took the Baker's father's newborn child Rapunzel.\nShe explains the curse will be lifted if the Baker and his Wife can find the four ingredients that the Witch needs for a certain potion; \"the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold,\" all before the chime of midnight in three days' time.\nAll begin their journeys into the woods&nbsp;&mdash; Jack goes to the market to sell his beloved pet Milky White, Cinderella's family goes to the Festival while Cinderella goes to her mother's grave to ask for guidance, Little Red goes to her grandmother's house, and the Baker, refusing his wife's help, goes to find the ingredients (\"Prologue\").\nCinderella visits her mother's grave and receives a beautiful gown and golden slippers from her mother's spirit (\"Cinderella at the Grave\").\nJack encounters a Mysterious Man who mocks him for trying to sell his cow for more than a \"sack of beans\" and then vanishes.\nLittle Red Ridinghood meets a hungry Wolf who convinces her to take a detour on her way to Granny's (\"Hello, Little Girl\").\nThe Baker sees Little Red Ridinghood in the woods, and when the Witch appears, screaming at him to get the red cape, he is so frightened that he forgets the ingredients he needs.\nLuckily his wife, who followed him into the forest, reminds him.\nThey are squabbling over her presence when they come across Jack with Milky White.\nNot having the money necessary to buy the cow, they convince Jack that the beans the Baker has found in his father's old hunting jacket are magic and buy the cow for five of them.\nJack bids a tearful goodbye to his cow (\"I Guess This Is Goodbye\"), and the Baker orders his wife to return to the village with the cow.\nHe has qualms about being so dishonest, but his wife reasons that the chance to have a child justifies their trickery (\"Maybe They're Magic\").\nThe Witch has raised Rapunzel as her own daughter, keeping her locked away from the world in a tall tower in the middle of the woods, accessible only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair (\"Our Little World\").\nHowever, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself.\nIn another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood.\nFollowing the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it.\nWhen Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf.\nThe Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards.\nLittle Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences (\"I Know Things Now\").\nMeanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper.\nAs Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball.\nCinderella explains that it was a nice ball (\"A Very Nice Prince\") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience.\nAs a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers.\nShe tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow.\nThe characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes (\"First Midnight\") and they continue their journeys through the woods.\nThe next morning, Jack describes his thrilling adventure after he returns from climbing the beanstalk and finding a castle of two married giants, whom he robbed unnoticed (\"Giants in the Sky\").\nHe gives the Baker five gold pieces he stole from the giants to buy back his cow.\nWhen the Baker hesitates, Jack climbs back up the beanstalk to find more.\nThe Mysterious Man emerges and taunts the Baker, stealing the money.\nThe Baker's Wife confesses she has lost the cow, and she and the Baker split up to look for it.\nCinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince, who are brothers, meet and compare the misery of their newfound and unobtainable loves (\"Agony\").\nThe Baker's Wife, who is eavesdropping, takes note when Rapunzel's prince mentions that he is in love with a girl in a tower with hair \"as yellow as corn\".\nThe Baker's Wife fools Rapunzel into letting down her hair by telling her that she is her prince and pulls out a piece of it.\nMeanwhile, The Mysterious Man gives Milky White back to the Baker.\nThe Baker's Wife and Cinderella meet again, and the Baker's Wife makes a desperate grab for her shoes, almost succeeding before Cinderella flees.\nThe Baker and his wife reunite, now with three of the four items.\nThe Baker admits that they will have to work together to fulfill the quest (\"It Takes Two\").\nJack arrives with a hen that lays golden eggs and attempts to buy Milky White back, but the

the Baker the money to buy another cow.\nJack encounters Little Red Ridinghood, who is now sporting a wolf skin cape and a knife for protection, and tries to impress her by telling her about the kingdom of the Giant.\nWhen she refuses to believe him, he is goaded into returning once again to the Giant's home to steal a magic harp.\nCinderella, returning from the last night of the festival, describes how the Prince had spread pitch on the stairs to prevent her from escaping.\nCaught between wanting to escape and wanting to stay, she eventually resolves to let the Prince decide, leaving him one of her slippers as a clue to her identity (\"On the Steps of the Palace\").\nThe Baker's Wife frantically tries to convince her to give up her other shoe, offering her the sixth magic bean in exchange for it.\nCinderella throws the bean aside, but trades shoes with the Baker's Wife and flees, while unbeknownst to anyone a second beanstalk starts to grow.\nThe Baker arrives with another cow; they now have all four items.\nThe Prince's Steward grabs the slipper from the Baker's Wife, and they are fighting over it when a great crash is heard and Jack's mother runs in to report that a Giant seeking revenge from Jack for stealing his magic harp has fallen from the first beanstalk when Jack chopped it and is dead in her backyard.\nThe Prince, more concerned with finding Cinderella, waves her off and departs with one of the slippers, giving the other to the Baker and his wife.\nJack, to the relief of his mother, returns with the magic harp.\nThe Witch discovers that the new cow is not pure white; it is covered with flour.\nHowever, the Witch is able to bring Milky White back to life and instructs the Baker and his Wife to feed the items to her.\nJack tries to milk her, but no milk comes.\nThe Baker's Wife admits that the hair is Rapunzel's, and the Witch furiously explains that the magic will not work because the Witch has already touched Rapunzel's hair, which is also why she had asked the Baker and his Wife to get the objects for her: she's not allowed to touch any of the objects.\nThe Mysterious Man tells the Baker to feed the hair-like corn silk to the cow.\nNow Milky White gives milk which is the potion.\nThe Witch reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father.\nThe Witch drinks the potion, and suddenly the Mysterious Man falls dead, his reparation complete, the curse is broken, and the Witch is transformed into a beautiful young woman, reversing the effects of the curse of ugliness by which she was punished by her mother, because the Baker's father stole the beans from her, regaining her youth and beauty.\nCinderella's Prince searches for the girl whose foot fits the slipper; the stepsisters try but can only get it on by cutting off parts of their feet (\"Careful My Toe\").\nCinderella appears, her foot fits the slipper, and she becomes the Prince's bride.\nRapunzel has borne twins in the desert where her Prince finds her.\nThe Witch attempts to curse the couple, only to find that though she gained her youth and beauty, her powers have been lost.\nAt Cinderella's wedding to the Prince, Florinda and Lucinda are blinded by birds as they try to win Cinderella's favor.\nEveryone but the Witch and the stepsisters congratulate themselves on being able to live happily \"Ever After,\" though they fail to notice another beanstalk growing sky-high.\nThe Narrator introduces the action again: \"Once Upon a Time.\nLater\".\nAll the characters seem happy but are still wishing: The Baker and his Wife have their precious baby boy, but wish for more room and bicker over the Baker's unwillingness to hold his child; Jack and his mother are rich and well-fed, but Jack misses his kingdom in the sky; Cinderella is living with her Prince Charming in the Palace, but is getting bored (\"So Happy\").\nSuddenly, everyone is knocked over by a loud crash, and enormous footprints from a Giant have destroyed the Witch's garden, sparing only a few beans.\nThe Baker and his Wife decide that they must tell the Royal Family, and the Baker travels to the palace.\nHis news is ignored by the Prince's Steward, and also by Jack's Mother when he stops at her house to ask for Jack's aid.\nWhen he returns home, Little Red Ridinghood arrives on her way to Granny's: her house has been destroyed and her mother is missing.\nThe Baker and his Wife decide to escort her.\nMeanwhile, Jack decides that he must slay the Giant and Cinderella learns from her bird friends that her mother's grave was disturbed and decides to investigate, dressed in her old clothes.\nOnce again, everyone heads Into the Woods, but this time the mood is somber and the birds have stopped singing (\"Into the Woods\" Reprise).\nWhile everyone else is drawn back into the woods, Rapunzel has fled there in a hysterical fit, her treatment at the hands of the Witch having driven her into madness.\nHer Prince has followed her, but when he encounters his brother they each confess they have another reason for their presence in the woods.\nThey have grown bored and frustrated with their marriages and now lust after two beautiful women asleep in the woods - Snow White and Sleeping Beauty (\"Agony\" Reprise).\nThe Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood get lost in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant.\nThe Witch arrives as well, bringing news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house.\nSuddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears.\nTo the shock of all, this Giant is a woman who has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed by chopping down the beanstalk.\nHer booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge.\nTo satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines.\nEveryone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him.\nNevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped.\nJack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her.\nAs the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch and her Prince (\"Witch's Lament\").\nThe Royal Family continue on their way,

they must find him first and split up to search.\nThe Baker's Wife meets Cinderella's Prince, and he easily seduces the Wife (\"Any Moment\").\nMeanwhile, the Baker discovers Cinderella at her mother's destroyed grave and convinces her to join their group for safety.\nThe Prince, satisfied, leaves the Baker's Wife with a few platitudes, and she realizes her error and decides to return to her happy life with the Baker and their son (\"Moments in the Woods\").\nHowever, she has lost her way, stumbles into the path of the Giant, and is consequently killed by a falling tree.\nThe Baker, Little Red, and Cinderella await the return of the Baker's Wife when the Witch drags in Jack, whom she found weeping over the Baker's Wife's body.\nThe Baker, grief-stricken when he learns of his wife's death, unwittingly agrees to give Jack to the Giantess, causing an argument.\nThe characters first blame each other for their predicament, until finally they all decide to blame the Witch for growing the beans in the first place (\"Your Fault\").\nDisgusted and fed up, the Witch curses and scolds them for their inability to accept their own individual responsibility and throws away the rest of her magic beans, reactivating her mother's curse and making her vanish (\"Last Midnight\").\nThe grieving Baker flees, but is visited by his father's spirit who convinces him to face his responsibilities (\"No More\").\nThe Baker returns and helps plan killing the Giantess, using Cinderella's bird friends to peck out the Giant's eyes at an area smeared with pitch, where Jack and the Baker can finally deliver a fatal blow.\nCinderella stays behind to protect the Baker's child and when her Prince passes by, he nearly fails to recognize her.\nShe confronts him, having learned of his infidelity from her birds and he explains his feelings of unfulfillment and his reasons for seducing another woman.\nShe asks him to go, and he sorrowfully leaves.\nLittle Red returns with the news that her grandmother has been killed by the Giantess.\nMeanwhile, the Baker tells Jack that his mother is dead.\nJack vows to kill the steward in revenge until the Baker convinces him that killing the steward will not benefit anyone.\nCinderella comforts Little Red and tries to answer her qualms that killing the Giant makes them no better than she is, while the Baker explains to Jack that everyone is responsible for the choices they make, good or bad (\"No One Is Alone\").\nThe four remaining characters slay the Giant and the deceased characters now including the Royal Family (who have lost their way and starved to death in the woods) and the Princes (who have their new paramours, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, on their arms) return to share one last set of morals with the audience.\nThe survivors resolve to band together and rebuild.\nThe spirit of the Baker's Wife appears to comfort her mourning husband advising her husband to tell their child their story.\nThe Baker begins to tell the story using the same words as the narrator did at the beginning of the play as the Witch appears with the final moral: \"Careful the things you say, Children Will Listen\".\nAll join in on a last reprise of the title song, surmising that we all must venture into the Woods while remembering the choices we've made and learning from each endeavor we come across (\"Finale\").\nAs

{"prompt": "The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)", "completion": " This is a recurring sketch always predicated on an unrelated sketch in which one character mentions that they \"didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition.\n\", often in irritation at being questioned by another.\nThe first appearance of the Spanish Inquisition occurs in a drawing room set in \"Jarrow, 1912\".\nA mill worker (Graham Chapman) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting (Carol Cleveland) that \"one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treadle\".\nWhen she says she doesn't know what he's talking about, the mill worker gets defensive and says, \"I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition.\n\" Then the Inquisition \u2014 consisting of Cardinal Xim\u00e9nez (Michael Palin) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles (Terry Jones) (who resembles his namesake Biggles wearing a leather aviator's helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam) \u2014 burst into the room to the sound of a jarring musical sting.\nXim\u00e9nez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: \"NO-body expects the Spanish Inquisition.\n\"  After entering, Xim\u00e9nez begins listing their weapons (\"fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency\"), but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin his list over again.\nAfter several attempts, Xim\u00e9nez states that he'll come in again, and herds the Inquisition back off the set.\nThe straight man mill worker repeats the cue line, the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew.\nBut Xim\u00e9nez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.\nXim\u00e9nez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of heresy against the woman.\nThe woman pleads innocent, and the cardinals respond with laughter (as an on-screen caption reads \"DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER\") and threats (as the on-screen caption changes to \"DIABOLICAL ACTING\").\nXim\u00e9nez intends to torture the woman with \"the rack\", but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack.\nThis rack is tied to the woman as Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever.\nThe Inquisition returns in a later sketch as an older woman (Marjorie Wilde) shares photographs with another woman (Cleveland), who rips them up as they are handed to her.\nWhen the older woman presents a photo of the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the house, the other woman says, \"I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\n\" The three cardinals then reappear and take the older woman away to a dungeon.\nBiggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions.\nWhen this fails, Xim\u00e9nez orders Fang to get \"the comfy chair\", which is brought out and the woman placed in it.\nXim\u00e9nez states that she must stay in the chair \"until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11\", and begins to shout at her to confess - only to have Biggles break down and confess.\nThis frustrates Xim\u00e9nez, but he can't complain about it, since he's distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene  At the end of the show, in the \"Court Charades\" sketch, a judge (Jones) who is also a defendant in an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey is casually sentenced by another judge (Chapman) to be burned at the stake.\nThe convicted judge responds, \"Blimey, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\n\" The whole court rises and looks expectantly at the witness entrance door, only for nothing to happen.\nAs the closing credits of the episode begin, the Inquisitors race out of a house and hop on a double-decker bus to the Old Bailey, all to the tune of \"Devil's Galop\".\nAs the Inquisitors ride in the bus, they comment worriedly that they are running out credits (which are seen on screen) and are panicked that the sketch will soon end.\nThe bus reaches the courthouse and the cardinals charge up the steps of the Old Bailey.\nWhen they finally burst into the courtroom, Xim\u00e9nez shouts, \"NO-body expects the Span-\", but is interrupted as the words \"THE END\" appear on-screen - to which Xim\u00e9nez concludes, \"Oh, bugger\".\nIn the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show the sketch ends when Xim\u00e9nez orders Biggles to \"torture\" the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge.\nWhen Biggles opens the door, the Man in the Fridge (Eric Idle) emerges and begins singing the \"Galaxy Song\" to the victim, while the Inquisition exit through the fridge.\n"}

{"prompt": "Moby-Dick", "completion": " Ishmael travels in December from Manhattan Island to New Bedford with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage.\nThe inn where he arrives is so crowded, he must share a bed with the tattooed Polynesian Queequeg, a harpooneer whose father was king of the (fictional) island of Rokovoko.\nThe next morning, Ishmael and Queequeg attend Father Mapple's sermon on Jonah, then head for Nantucket.\nIshmael signs up with the Quaker ship-owners Bildad and Peleg for a voyage on their whaler Pequod.\nPeleg describes Captain Ahab: \"He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man\" who nevertheless \"has his humanities\".\nThey hire Queequeg the following morning.\nA man named Elijah prophesies a dire fate should Ishmael and Queequeg join Ahab.\nWhile provisions are loaded, shadowy figures board the ship.\nOn a cold Christmas Day, the Pequod leaves the harbor.\nIshmael discusses cetology (the zoological classification and natural history of the whale), and describes the crew members.\nThe chief mate is 30-year-old Starbuck, a Nantucket Quaker with a realist mentality, whose harpooneer is Queequeg; second mate is Stubb, from Cape Cod, happy-go-lucky and cheerful, whose harpooneer is Tashtego, a proud, pure-blooded Indian from Gay Head, and the third mate is Flask, from Martha's Vineyard, short, stout, whose harpooneer is Daggoo, a tall African, now a resident of Nantucket.\nWhen Ahab finally appears on the quarterdeck, he announces he is out for revenge on the white whale which took one leg from the knee down and left him with a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone.\nAhab will give the first man to sight Moby Dick a doubloon, a gold coin, which he nails to the mast.\nStarbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit.\nAhab's purpose exercises a mysterious spell on Ishmael: \"Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine\".\nInstead of rounding Cape Horn, Ahab heads for the equatorial Pacific Ocean via southern Africa.\nOne afternoon, as Ishmael and Queequeg are weaving a mat \u2014 \"its warp seemed necessity, his hand free will, and Queequeg's sword chance\" \u2014 Tashtego sights a sperm whale.\nImmediately, five hidden figures appear whom Ahab has brought as his own boat crew.\nTheir leader, Fedallah, a Parsee, is Ahab's harpooneer.\nThe pursuit is unsuccessful.\nSoutheast of the Cape of Good Hope, the Pequod makes the first of nine sea-encounters, or \"gams\", with other ships: Ahab hails the Goney (Albatross) to ask whether they have seen the White Whale, but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer.\nIshmael explains that because of Ahab's absorption with Moby Dick, he sails on without the customary \"gam\", which defines as a \"social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships\", in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other.\nIn the second gam off the Cape of Good Hope, with the Town-Ho, a Nantucket whaler, the concealed story of a \"judgment of God\" is revealed, but only to the crew: a defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer is flogged, and when that officer led the chase for Moby Dick, he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale.\nIshmael digresses on pictures of whales, brit (microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed), squid and&nbsp;\u2014 after four boats lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid for the white whale&nbsp;\u2014 whale-lines.\nThe next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the Pequods black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak.\nFleece delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it.\nThe whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out.\nStanding at the head of the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea.\nThe Pequod next encounters the Jeroboam, which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by an epidemic.\nThe whale carcass still lies in the water.\nQueequeg mounts it, tied to Ishmael's belt by a monkey-rope as if they were Siamese twins.\nStubb and Flask kill a right whale whose head is fastened to a yardarm opposite the sperm whale's head.\nIshmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way: the right whale is Lockean, stoic, and the sperm whale as Kantean, platonic.\nTashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of oil.\nHe falls into the head, and the head falls off the yardarm into the sea.\nQueequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword.\nThe Pequod next gams with the Jungfrau from Bremen.\nBoth ships sight whales simultaneously, with the Pequod winning the contest.\nThe three harpooneers dart their harpoons, and Flask delivers the mortal strike with a lance.\nThe carcass sinks, and Queequeg barely manages to escape.\nThe Pequods next gam is with the French whaler Bouton de Rose, whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession.\nStubb talks them out of it, but Ahab orders him away.\nDays later, an encounter with a harpooned whale prompts Pip, a little black cabin-boy from Alabama, to jump out of his whale boat.\nThe whale must be cut loose, because the line has Pip so entangled in it.\nFurious, Stubb orders Pip to stay in the whale boat, but Pip later jumps again, and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up.\nCooled sperm oil congeals and must be squeezed back into liquid state; blubber is boiled in the try-pots on deck; the warm oil is decanted into casks, and then stowed in the ship.\nAfter the operation, the decks are scrubbed.\nThe coin hammered to the main mast shows three Andes summits, one with a flame, one with a tower, and one a crowing cock.\nAhab stops to look at the doubloon and interprets the coin as signs of his firmness, volcanic energy, and victory; Starbuck takes the high peaks as evidence of the Trinity; Stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains; and Flask sees nothing of any symbolic value at all.\nThe Manxman mutters in front of the mast, and Pip declines the verb \"look\".\nThe Pequod next gams with the Samuel Enderby of London, captained by Boomer, a down-to-earth fellow who lost his right arm to Moby Dick.\nNevertheless, he carries no ill will toward the whale, which he regards not as malicious, but as awkward.\nAhab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship.\nThe narrator now discusses the subjects of 1) whalers supply; 2) a glen in Tranque in the Arsacides islands full of carved whale bones, fossil whales, whale skeleton measurements; 3) the chance that the magnitude of the whale will diminish and that the leviathan might perish.\nLeaving the Samuel Enderby, Ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another.\nStarbuck informs Ahab of oil leakage in the hold.\nReluctantly, Ahab orders the harpooneers to inspect the casks.\nQueequeg, sweating all day below decks, develops a chill and soon is almost mortally feverish.\nThe carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea.\nQueequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness.\nYet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health.\nHenceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later caulked and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy.\nThe Pequod sails northeast toward Formosa and into the Pacific Ocean.\nAhab, with one nostril, smells the musk from the Bashee isles, and with the other, the salt of the waters where Moby Dick swims.\nAhab goes to Perth, the blacksmith, with bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of a special harpoon, and with his razors for Perth to melt and fashion into a harpoon barb.\nAhab tempers the barb in blood from Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo.\nThe Pequod gams next with the Bachelor, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil.\nEvery now and then, the Pequod lowers for whales with success.\nOn one of those nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses \u2014 one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood \u2014 that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.\nAs the Pequod approaches the Equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be.\nHe dashes it to the deck.\nThat evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship.\nLightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow.\nAhab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick.\nStarbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket.\nNext morning, when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle.\nHe orders the log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location.\nThe Pequod is now heading southeast toward Moby Dick.\nA man falls overboard from the mast.\nThe life buoy is thrown, but both sink.\nNow Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin be used as a new life buoy.\nStarbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked.\nNext morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket.\nThe Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick.\nAmong the missing is Gardiner's young son.\nAhab refuses to join the search.\nTwenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him.\nSuddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it.\nNext, the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick.\nHer captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward.\nAhab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck.\nAhab speaks about his wife and child, calls himself a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye.\nStarbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.\nOn the first day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick.\nHe claims the doubloon for himself, and orders all boats to lower except for Starbuck's.\nThe whale bites Ahab's boat in two, tosses the captain out of it, and scatters the crew.\nOn the second day of the chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of the Pequod.\nMoby Dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines.\nAhab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost.\nStarbuck begs Ahab to desist, but Ahab vows to slay the white whale, even if he would have to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge.\nOn the third day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well.\nAhab lowers his boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board.\nMoby Dick breaches and destroys two boats.\nFedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, so Moby Dick turns out to be the hearse Fedallah prophesied.\n\"Possessed by all the fallen angels\", Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank.\nMoby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea.\nOnly Ishmael is unable to return to the boat.\nHe is left behind in the sea, and so is the only crewman of the Pequod to survive the final encounter.\nThe whale now fatally attacks the Pequod.\nAhab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of American wood in Fedallah's prophesy.\nThe whale returns to Ahab, who stabs at him again.\nThe line loops around Ahab's neck, and as the stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight.\nQueequeg's coffin comes to the surface, the only thing to escape the vortex when Pequod sank.\nFor an entire day, Ishmael floats on it, and then the Rachel, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.\n"}

at \"Megagamers\", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games.\nHis employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store.\nLargo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias \"Great Teacher Largo\" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about computers.\nYuki's father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the \"Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division\" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.\nAs Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings.\nShe then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons.\nPiro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.\nEarlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there.\nLater on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and

next time they meet.\nDespite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them.\nLater on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status.\nAngered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration.\nLater, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt.\nPiro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras.\nThe scene

the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos.\nOn the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.\nMeanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro's coworker at Megagamers.\nShe and Kimiko share a house.\nAs with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story.\nLater, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fianc\u00e9 left her.\nWhen she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it.\nHe then offers to help Erika to deal with her \"vulnerabilities in the digital plane\".\nErika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building.\nThis leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.\nThe enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists.\nMiho knows Piro and Largo from the Endgames MMORPG previous to Megatokyo's plot.\nShe abused a

current motivations and ultimate goal.\nMiho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).\nAfter getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments.\nNot long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as

know that she won't shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions.\nLargo leaves for Erika's apartment after she calls looking for help.\nThat night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo's help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home.\nThe next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.\nKimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping.\nMiho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika.\nDom is also there to talk with Kimiko.\nAfter rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things.\nMiho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area.\nDom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses.\nDrained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone.\nPiro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner.\nThe group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt.\nPiro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, Sight.\nBesides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area.\nMiho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.\nLargo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak.\nLargo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko.\nUnfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it.\nYuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father's chagrin.\nAfter the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier.\nMiho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro.\nShe is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed's gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed's Kill-Bots.\nDuring the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other.\nLargo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fianc\u00e9.\nKimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on Sight, which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom.\nPing is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who hasn't been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance.\nPing and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho.\nYuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this.\nThat night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and Endgames, which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there.\nThis leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her.\nKimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for Sight and then they say goodnight and leave.\nHe returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning.\nOnce at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko.\nDuring all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho.\nHis current location is unknown.\nAside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved.\nEd, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika.\nYuki and Yutaka get Piro's laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him.\nGoing to a \"hidden-in-plain-sight\" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state.\nDuring a heated argument and Miho's goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club.\nShortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next.\nMiho appears to be collapsing.\nUpon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club's sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club.\nDuring this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the \"hospital\" room, where he discovers that she is missing.\nFollowing the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home.\nHowever, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone's return.\nThe next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance.\nHe is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell.\nPiro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment.\nPiro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events.\nShe explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted.\nSince Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to \"build a 'real' me\", as Miho explains it.\nDuring the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was.\nLargo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation.\nAfter a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do.\nJunko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns from last night with her.\nAfter receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami.\nShe goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a \"monster\", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood.\nRealizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him.\nYutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night.\nYutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho.\nHowever, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance.\nThough Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyways and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho.\nIt is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat.\nAt the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow.\nSeeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process.\nYuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka.\nMiho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house.\nJust before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand.\nThe pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.\n"}

Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with the mechanic.\nThey begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory kills him when he recognizes her as a wanted killer.\nDuring this time, Mickey rapes the hostage.\nThe pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming fifty-two victims in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\nPursuing them is Detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman when he was eight.\nBeneath his heroic facade, he is a violent psychopath, once strangling a

from one of the dead guards, but gets so frenzied that Mickey prefers to disarm him.\nAfter being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft, the trio of Mickey, Mallory, and Gale run into McClusky and a heavily armed posse of guards.\nThe trio takes cover in a blood-splattered shower room.\nMcClusky threatens to storm the shower room; Mickey, in turn, threatens to kill both Gale and a

inmates.\nMickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard; Owen's fate is unknown.\nEscaping to a rural location, they give a final interview to Gale, whose ear they have seemingly removed (implied, but as a camera track reveals), before they tell him he must die also.\nHe attempts various arguments to change their minds, finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor; Mickey informs him they are leaving a witness to tell the tale, his camera.\nGale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if on a cross as they shoot him dead while his unattended camera continues to roll.\nThe couple is shown several years later, in an RV, with Mickey driving and a pregnant Mallory watching their two children play.\n"}

otherwise they will dissolve, disabling him again.\nHe also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his liver, leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and apparently ending his drug addiction.\nCase develops a close personal relationship with Molly, who suggests that he begin looking into Armitage's background.\nMeanwhile, Armitage assigns them their first job: they must steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors, legendary cyber-cowboy McCoy Pauley, nicknamed \"Dixie Flatline\".\nArmitage needs Pauley's hacking expertise, and the ROM construct is stored in the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate Sense/Net.\nA street gang named the \"Panther Moderns\" is hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on Sense/Net.\nThe diversion allows Molly to penetrate the building and steal Dixie's ROM with Case unlocking the computer safeguards on the way in and out from within the matrix.\nCase and Molly continue to investigate Armitage, discovering his former identity of Colonel Willis Corto.\nCorto was a member of \"Operation Screaming Fist,\" which planned on infiltrating and disrupting Soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over Russia.\nThe Russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible, but the military went ahead with Screaming Fist, with a new secret purpose of testing these Russian defenses.\nAs the Operation team attacked a Soviet computer center, EMP weapons shut down their computers and flight systems, and Corto and his men were targeted by Soviet laser defenses.\nHe and a few survivors commandeered a Soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded Finnish border.\nEveryone was killed except Corto, who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by Finnish defense forces attacking the helicopter as it landed.\nAfter some months in the hospital, Corto was visited by a Government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realize was fake testimony, designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the EMP weapons.\nAfter the trials, Corto snapped, killing the Government official who had contacted him and then disappearing into the criminal underworld.\nIn Istanbul, the team recruits Peter Riviera, an artist, thief, and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants.\nAlthough Riviera is a sociopath, Armitage coerces him into joining the team.\nThe trail leads Case and Molly to Wintermute, a powerful artificial intelligence created by the Tessier-Ashpool family.\nThe Tessier-Ashpools spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation in a labyrinthine mansion known as Villa Straylight, located at one end of Freeside, a cylindrical space habitat at L5, which functions primarily as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy.\nWintermute's nature is finally revealed\u2014it is one-half of a super-AI entity planned by the family, although its exact purpose is unknown.\nThe Turing Law Code governing AIs bans the construction of such entities; to get around this, it had to be built as two separate AIs.\nWintermute (housed in a computer mainframe in Berne, Switzerland) was programmed by the Tessier-Ashpools with a need to merge with its other half, Neuromancer (whose physical mainframe is installed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).\nUnable to achieve this merger on its own, Wintermute recruited Armitage and his team to help complete the goal.\nCase is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the Turing-imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program.\nAt the same time, Riviera is to obtain the password to the Turing lock from Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool, an unfrozen daughter clone and the current CEO of the family's corporation, Tessier-Ashpool SA.\nWintermute believes Riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her, and that she will give him the password.\nThe password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in Villa Straylight, and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace\u2014otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact.\nArmitage's team attracts the attention of the Turing Police, whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations.\nAs Molly and Riviera gain entrance to Villa Straylight, three officers arrest Case and take him into custody; Wintermute manipulates the orbital casino's security and maintenance systems and kills the officers, allowing Case to escape.\nThe Armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the Corto personality as he relives Screaming Fist.\nIt is revealed that in the past, Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence, eventually convincing Corto that he was Armitage.\nWintermute used him to persuade Case and Molly to help it merge with its twin AI, Neuromancer.\nFinally, Armitage becomes the shattered Corto again, but his newfound personality is short-lived, as he is killed when Wintermute ejects him through an airlock into space.\nInside Villa Straylight, Riviera meets Lady 3Jane and tries to stop the mission, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, her ninja bodyguard, to capture Molly.\nWorried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute, Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum, his Rastafarian pilot.\nNeuromancer attempts to trap Case within a cyber-construct where he finds the consciousness of Linda Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of Case's underworld contacts.\nCase manages to escape after Maelcum gives him an overdose of a drug that can bypass his augmented liver and pancreas.\nThen, with Wintermute guiding them, Case goes with Maelcum to confront Lady 3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo.\nRiviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him.\nRiviera blinds Hideo with a concentrated laser pulse from his projector implant, but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight.\nMolly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed anyway, as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs, which she had spiked.\nWith Lady 3Jane in possession of the password, the team makes it to the computer terminal.\nCase enters cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password, and the lock is opened.\nWintermute unites with Neuromancer, fusing into a superconsciousness.\nThe poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out, and he and Molly are profusely paid for their efforts, while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased, at his own request.\nIn the epilogue, Molly leaves Case.\nCase finds a new girlfriend, resumes his hacking work, and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use.\nWintermute/Neuromancer contacts him, saying that it has become \"the sum total of the works, the whole show,\" and has begun looking for other AIs like itself.\nScanning old recorded transmissions from the 1970s, the super-AI finds an AI transmitting from the Alpha Centauri star system.\nIn the matrix, Case hears inhuman laughter, a trait associated with Pauley during Case's work with his ROM construct, thus suggesting that Pauley was not erased after all, but instead worked out a side deal with Wintermute/Neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix.\nIn the end, while logged into the matrix, Case catches a glimpse of himself, his dead girlfriend Linda Lee, and Neuromancer.\nThe implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness when it previously tried to trap him.\nThe copy of Case's consciousness now exists with that of Linda's, in the matrix, where they are together forever.\n"}

arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery.\nBob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration.\nThe conversation ends when

gold above else.\nThe Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold.\nThe supposed reward is soon revealed to be a

{"prompt": "Paths of Glory", "completion": " The film begins with a voiceover describing the trench warfare situation of World War I up to 1916.\nIn a ch\u00e2teau, General Georges Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), a member of the French General Staff, asks his subordinate, the ambitious General Mireau (George Macready), to send his division on a suicide mission to take a well-defended German position called the \"Anthill\".\nMireau initially refuses, citing the impossibility of success and the danger to his beloved soldiers, but when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.\nMireau proceeds to walk through the trenches, asking several soldiers, \"Ready to kill more Germans.\n\" He throws a disturbed private (Fred Bell) out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock, which Mireau considers simple cowardice.\nMireau leaves the detailed planning of the attack to the 701st Regiment\u2019s Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), despite Dax's protests that the only result of the attack will be to weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit.\nDuring a nighttime scouting mission prior to the attack, a drunken lieutenant named Roget (Wayne Morris) sends one of his two men ahead as a scout.\nOvercome by fear while waiting for the scout's return, he lobs a grenade and retreats.\nThe other soldier\u2014Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker)\u2014finds the body of the scout, killed by the grenade.\nHaving safely returned, he confronts Roget, but Roget denies any wrongdoing, and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.\nThe next morning, the attack on the Anthill proceeds.\nDax leads the first wave of soldiers over the top into no man's land under heavy fire, but the attack is a failure.\nNone of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuse to leave their own trench after sustaining heavy casualties.\nMireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield.\nThe artillery commander refuses to fire on his own men without written confirmation of the order.\nMeanwhile, Dax returns to the trenches, and tries to rally B Company to join the battle, but as he climbs out of the trench, the body of a dead French soldier knocks him down.\nTo deflect blame for the failure, Mireau decides to court martial 100 of the soldiers for cowardice.\nBroulard convinces him to reduce the number to three, one from each company.\nCorporal Paris is chosen because his commanding officer, Roget, wishes to keep him from testifying about his actions in the scouting mission.\nPrivate Ferol (Timothy Carey) is picked by his commanding officer because he is a \"social undesirable\".\nThe last man, Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), is chosen randomly by lot, despite having been cited for bravery twice previously.\nDax, who was a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial.\nThe trial, however, is a farce.\nDax protests the lack of a stenographic record, the lack of a formal written indictment, and the court's refusal to admit evidence that would support acquittal.\nIn his closing statement, Dax challenges the court's authenticity, and requests mercy, saying, \"Gentlemen of the court, to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die\".\nNonetheless, the three men are sentenced to death.\nCaptain Rousseau (John Stein), the artillery commander who had earlier refused Mireau's order to fire on his own men, arrives to tell Dax about the incident.\nDax confronts Broulard as he is attending a ball with sworn statements by the witnesses attesting to Mireau's order to shell his own trenches, and tries to blackmail the General Staff into sparing his men.\nBroulard takes the statements but brusquely dismisses Dax.\nThe next morning, the three condemned men are led out into a courtyard, among soldiers from all three companies

killed by the firing squad.\nFollowing the execution, Broulard has breakfast with the gloating Mireau.\nDax enters, invited by Broulard.\nBroulard then reveals that Mireau will be investigated for the order to fire on his own men.\nMireau leaves angrily, protesting that he has been made a scapegoat.\nBroulard then blithely offers Mireau's command to Dax, assuming that Dax's attempts to stop the executions were a ploy to gain Mireau's job.\nDiscovering that Dax is in fact sincere, Broulard angrily rebukes him for his idealism while a disgusted Dax calls Broulard a \"degenerate, sadistic old man\".\nAfter the execution, some of Dax's soldiers are raucously partying at an inn.\nTheir mood shifts as they listen to a captive German girl (Christiane Harlan, later Kubrick) sing a sentimental

{"prompt": "The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch", "completion": " The story begins in a future world where global temperatures have risen so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours.\nIn a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth, the UN has initiated a \"draft\" for colonizing the nearby planets, where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (CAN-D) in concert with \"layouts\".\nLayouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonists in their marginal off-world colonies, or even Earth, where global warming has progressed to the point that Antarctica is prime vacation resort territory.\nThe illegal drug CAN-D allows people to \"share\" their experience of the \"Perky Pat\" (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) layouts.\nThis \"sharing\" has caused a pseudo-religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug.\nUp to the point where the novel begins, New York City-based Perky Pat (orP) Layouts, Inc, has held a monopoly on this product, as well as on the illegal trade in the drug CAN-D which makes the shared hallucinations possible.\nThe novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson,P.\nLayouts' top precog, has received a \"draft notice\" from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on Mars.\nMayerson is sleeping with his assistant, Roni Fugate, but remains conflicted about the divorce, which he himself initiated, from his first wife Emily, a ceramic pot artist.\nMeanwhile, Emily's second husband tries to sell her pot designs toP.\nLayouts as possible accessories for the Perky Pat virtual worlds\u2014but Barney, recognizing them as Emily's, rejects them out of spite.\nMeanwhile, the UN rescues Palmer Eldritch's ship from a crash on Pluto.\nLeo Bulero, head ofP.\nLayouts and an \"evolved\" human (meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a German \"doctor\" which are supposed to push the client \"forward\" on an evolutionary scale, and which result in gross physical, as well as mental, modifications), hears rumors that Eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the Prox system with similar properties to CAN-D, and that he plans to market it as \"Chew-Z,\" with UN approval, on off-world colonies.\nHowever CHEW-Z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of CHEW-Z even more addictive than CAN-D has been.\nThis would effectively destroyP.\nLayouts.\nBulero tries to contact Eldritch but he is quarantined at a UN hospital.\nBoth Mayerson and Fugate have precognitions of reports that Bulero is going to be responsible for murdering Eldritch.\nMeanwhile, Emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to Eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy.\nUnfortunately, Emily begins to devolve rather than evolve.\nThis devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older, less sophisticated designs from earlier work, without realizing it.\nUnder the guise of a reporter, Bulero travels to Eldritch's estate on the Moon, where Eldritch holds a press conference.\nBulero is kidnapped and forced to take Chew-Z intravenously.\nHe enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and Eldritch seemingly have some control.\nAfter wrangling about business with Eldritch, Bulero travels to what appears to be Earth at some time in the not-too-distant future.\nEvolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of Eldritch, an \"enemy of the Sol System\".\nBulero returns to Earth and fires Mayerson because Mayerson was afraid to travel to the Moon to rescue him.\nMayerson, in despair, accepts his UN conscription to Mars but Bulero recruits him as a double agent.\nMayerson is to inject himself with a toxin after taking Chew-Z in a plot to deceive the UN into thinking Chew-Z is harmful and cause them to ban it.\nOn Mars, Mayerson buys some Chew-Z from Eldritch, who appears in holographic form.\nMayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with Emily but finds that he does not control his apparent hallucination.\nLike Bulero, he finds himself in the future.\nMayerson arrives in New York two years hence where he speaks with Bulero, Fugate and his future self about the death of Palmer Eldritch.\nHe also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch, identifiable by their robotic right hand, artificial eyes, and steel teeth.\nEldritch offers to help Mayerson become whatever he wants, but is so controlling of the CHEW-Z alternate reality that Mayerson ultimately decides he'd rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by Eldritch.\nWhen a despairing Mayerson chooses death, he finds himself apparently forced into Eldritch's body right at the point in the timeline where Bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at Eldritch's ship.\nIt appears that Eldritch's plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in Mayerson's body while allowing Mayerson himself to die in Eldritch's place.\nEldritch, meanwhile, intends to live on in Mayerson's form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a Martian colonist.\nMayerson, stuck in Eldritch's body and mistaken for him, is indeed nearly killed by Bulero in the near future, but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his Chew-Z trance in the present by Bulero, who has just arrived on Mars.\nBulero is willing to take Mayerson back to Earth but refuses to after learning that Mayerson did not inject himself with the toxin.\nMayerson is now confident that Bulero will kill Eldritch, so the sacrifice of taking the toxin in order to ruin Eldritch's business is unnecessary; but he does not try to convince Bulero of this.\nLater, Mayerson discusses his experience with a neo-Christian colonist and they conclude that either Eldritch became a god in the Prox system or some god-like being has taken his place.\nMayerson is convinced some aspect of Eldritch is still inside him, and that as long as he refuses to take Chew-Z again, it is Eldritch who will actually be killed by Bulero in the near future; Mayerson is half-resigned, half-hopeful about taking on the life of a Martian colonist without reprieve.\nMayerson considers the possibility of Eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god, but inimical, or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god.\nThe novel has an ambiguous ending, with Bulero heading back toward Earth, and

Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection.\nA second assassination attempt was made on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in F\u00e1tima, Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a bayonet.\nHe was stopped by security guards.\nStanis\u0142aw Dziwisz later said that John Paul II had been injured during the attempt but managed to hide a non-life-threatening wound.\nThe assailant, a traditionalist Catholic Spanish priest named Juan Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez y Krohn, had been ordained as a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the Society of Saint Pius X and was opposed to the changes made by the Second Vatican Council, claiming that the pope was an agent of Communist Moscow and of the Marxist Eastern Bloc.\nFern\u00e1ndez y Krohn subsequently left the priesthood and served three years of a six-year sentence.\nThe ex-priest was treated for mental illness and then expelled from Portugal to become a solicitor in Belgium.\nThe Al-Qaeda-funded Bojinka plot planned to kill John Paul II during a visit to the Philippines during World Youth Day 1995 celebrations.\nOn 15 January 1995 a suicide bomber was planning to dress as a priest and detonate a bomb when the pope passed in his motorcade on his way to the San Carlos Seminary in Makati City.\nThe assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation.\nHowever, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the pope's visit, and confessed to the plot.\nIn 2009 John Koehler, a journalist and former army intelligence officer, published Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church.\nMining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were \"KGB-backed\" and gives details.\nDuring John Paul II's papacy there were many clerics within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church.\nThere is wide speculation that they were, in reality, KGB agents.\n"}

regimen of boosterspice) but is bored.\nHe has experienced life thoroughly, and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of Known Space, all alone in a spaceship for a year or more.\nHe is confronted by Nessus, a Pierson's Puppeteer, and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond Known Space.\nSpeaker-to-Animals (Speaker), who is a Kzin, and Teela Brown, a young human woman, also join the voyage.\nThey first travel to the Puppeteer home world, where they learn that the expedition's goal is to explore Ringworld, an artificial ring about one million miles (1,600,000 km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's orbit (which makes it about 600,000,000 miles or 950,000,000 km in circumference), encircling a sunlike star.\nIt rotates, providing artificial gravity that is 992% as strong as Earth's gravity through the action of centrifugal force.\nThe Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million Earth-sized planets.\nNight is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire (shadow-square wire).\nNone of the crew's attempts at contacting the Ringworld succeed, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworld's automated meteoroid-defense system.\nThe severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands on the Ringworld near a huge mountain.\nThe ship's defenses keep the crew compartment and many of the ship's systems intact, including the faster-than-light drive (hyperdrive), but the normal drive is destroyed, leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive.\nThe team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space, as well as fulfilling their original mission \u2013 learning more about the Ringworld.\nUsing their flycycles (similar to antigravity motorcycles), they try to reach the rim of the ring, where they hope to find some technology that will help them.\nIt will take them months to cross the vast distance.\nWhen Teela develops \"Plateau trance\" (a kind of highway hypnosis) from becoming too absorbed in watching the vast landscape ahead, they find themselves forced to land.\nOn the ground, they encounter apparently human Ringworld natives.\nThe natives, who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city, think that the crew are the Engineers of the Ring, whom they revere as gods.\nThe crew is attacked when they commit what the natives consider blasphemy (the misuse of certain technologies).\nThey continue their journey during which Nessus is forced to reveal some Puppeteer secrets: they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans (breeding for luck) and kzin (breeding for less aggressiveness).\nThe resulting hostility forces Nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance.\nThey encounter a city and, in a floating building, they find a map of the Ringworld and videos of its past civilization.\nIn a giant storm, caused by air escaping through a hole in the Ring floor due to meteoroid impact, Teela is blown away in an unknown direction.\nWhile Louis and Speaker search for her in a ruined city, their flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders.\nThey are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station.\nNessus arrives, entering the station to help his team.\nIn the station they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan (\"Prill\"), a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the Ringworld and other inhabited worlds.\nHer ship was stranded on the Ringworld when the landing mechanism failed.\nShe relates what she learned of the downfall of the Ringworld's civilization: A mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship.\nWithout its superconductive technology, civilization fell.\nTeela reaches the police station, accompanied by her new lover, a native \"hero\" called Seeker who helped her survive.\nBased on his studies of an ancient Ringworld map, Louis devises a plan to escape.\nThe four explorers, with Seeker and Prill, use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers' crashed ship.\nTeela and Seeker choose to remain on Ringworld.\nThe remaining explorers and Prill collect one end of the shadow-square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed, dragging the wire behind them as they travel.\nReaching the wreck, Louis threads the wire through the ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station.\nStill in the station, he then continues to pull the wire onward, up to the summit of \"Fist-of-God\", the enormous mountain near their crash site.\nThe massive mountain had not appeared on a map of the original Ringworld, leading Louis to conclude that it was in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the \"mountain\" up from the ring floor and broke through.\nThe top of the mountain, above the edge of the ring's atmosphere, is therefore a passage to the underside of the Ringworld and freedom.\nLouis drives the police station over the edge of the crater.\nThe Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the police station and ship are free of the ring, their speed is enough to get them back to open space in a reasonable time.\nThe crew can then use the ship's hyperdrive to get home.\nThe book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.\n"}

{"prompt": "Rendezvous with Rama", "completion": " After an asteroid falls in Northeast Italy in 2077, creating a major disaster, the government of Earth sets up the Spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space.\nThe \"Rama\" of the title is an alien starship, initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as \"31/439\".\nIt is detected by astronomers in the year 2131 while it is still outside the orbit of Jupiter.\nIts speed (100,000&nbsp;km/h) and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate it is not on a long orbit around the sun, but comes from interstellar space.\nThe astronomers' interest is further piqued when they realise the asteroid has an extremely rapid rotation period of 4 minutes and is exceptionally large.\nIt is named Rama after the Hindu god, and an unmanned space probe dubbed Sita is launched from the Mars moon Phobos to intercept and photograph it.\nThe resulting images reveal that Rama is a perfect cylinder, in diameter and long, and completely featureless, making this humankind's first encounter with an alien spacecraft.\nThe manned solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama, as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in our solar system.\nEndeavour manages to rendezvous with Rama one month after it first comes to Earth's attention, when the alien ship is already inside Venus' orbit.\nThe 20+ crew, led by Commander Bill Norton, enters Rama through a dual safety system consisting of two sets of triple airlocks, six in all, and explores the vast 16-km wide by 50-km long cylindrical world of its interior, but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remain enigmatic throughout the book.\nThe astronauts discover that Rama is hollow, and that its inner surfaces hold vast \"cities\" of geometric structures that resemble buildings and are separated by streets with shallow trenches.\nA mammoth band of water, dubbed the Cylindrical Sea, stretches around Rama's central circumference.\nMassive cones, which the astronauts theorise are part of Rama's propulsion system, stand at its 'southern' end.\nThey also find that Rama's atmosphere is breathable.\nOne of the crew members, Jimmy Pak, who has experience with low gravity skybikes, volunteers to ride a smuggled skybike along Rama's axis to the far end, otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the 500-m high cliff on the opposite shore.\nA few hours later, Jimmy reaches the massive metal cones on the southern end of Rama, and detects a strange magnetic field coming from the cones.\nHe takes some photos of the area and the strange plateau on the southern end of Rama's landmass.\nAs he leaves the area, the electrical charge in its atmosphere increases, resulting in lightning.\nA discharge hits his skybike, causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent.\nWhen Pak wakes up, he sees a crab-like creature picking up his skybike and chopping it into pieces.\nHe cannot decide whether it is a robot or a biological alien, and keeps his distance while radioing for help.\nAs Pak waits, Norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea, using a small, improvised craft, constructed earlier for exploration of the sea's central island.\nPak sees the crab-like creature dump the skybike's remains into the sea.\nThe creature then walks towards but ultimately ignores him.\nPak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea.\nAmongst the strange geometric structures, he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment, and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research.\nPak jumps off the 500 m cliff, his descent slowed by the low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute, and is quickly rescued by the waiting boat.\nAs they ride back, tidal waves form in the cylindrical sea, created by the movements of Rama itself as it makes course corrections.\nWhen the crew arrives at base, they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp.\nWhen one is found damaged and apparently lifeless, the team's doctor/biologist Surgeon-Commander Laura Ernst inspects it, and discovers it to be a hybrid biological entity and robot\u2014eventually termed a \"biot\".\nIt, and by assumption the others, are powered by natural internal batteries (much like those of terrestrial electric eels) and possess some intelligence.\nThey are believed to be the drones of Rama's still-absent builders.\nThe members of the Rama Committee and the United Planets, both based on the moon, have been monitoring events inside Rama and giving feedback.\nThe Hermian colonists have concluded that Rama is a potential threat and send a rocket-mounted nuclear bomb to destroy it should it prove to pose a threat, but lt Boris Rodrigo uses a pair of wire cutters to defuse the bomb and its control.\nAs Rama approaches perihelion, the biots jump into the cylindrical sea, where they are destroyed (or recycled) by aquatic biots ('sharks') and reabsorbed into the mineral-laden water.\nOn their final expedition, some crew members decide to visit the city christened \"London\" (as it is closest to Rama's \"northern\" end, the point of their entry), where they use a laser to cut open one of the \"buildings\" to see what it houses.\nThey discover transparent pedestals containing holograms of various artefacts, which they theorise are used by the Ramans as templates for creating tools and other objects.\nThe most amazing of these appears to be a uniform with bandoliers, straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the Ramans.\nAs the crew photographs some of the holograms, the six gigantic striplights that illuminate Rama's interior start to dim, prompting the explorers to leave and re-board Endeavour.\nWith Endeavour a safe distance away, Rama reaches perihelion and utilizes the Sun's gravitational field, and its mysterious \"space drive\", to perform a slingshot manoeuvre which flings it out of the solar system and towards an unknown destination in the direction of the Large

releasing an ancient curse around the dig site, resurrecting scores of zombies from their slumber.\nPushing through the mummies and Nazis,J and Agent One are led to an airfield and a location to follow.\nAs they tail the SS, the two are shot down near Austria and captured by the Nazis.\nAgent One and Blazkowicz are carted away and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, a remote, medieval castle that serves as a stronghold, prison, and research station.\nDuring their incarceration, Agent One is tortured for information and dies from electrocution exposureJ, however, manages to escape Castle Wolfenstein's dungeon and fights his way out of the castle, using a cable car to leave the area and meet up with Kessler, a member of the German resistance in a nearby village.\nMeanwhile, the SS Paranormal Division, under Oberf\u00fchrer Helga von Bulow, has long since moved from Egypt and has been excavating the catacombs and crypts of an ancient church within the village itself in search of the resting place of a \"Dark Knight\".\nThe Division's sloppy precautions have led to the release of an ancient curse and the awakening of hordes of undead creatures, this time including Saxon knights.\nThe majority of the SS finally realize the dangers and seal off the entrance into the catacombs, leaving many soldiers trapped insideJ.\ndescends regardless and fights both Nazis and undead until he arrives at the ancient house of worship, the Defiled Church, where Nazi scientist Professor Zemph is conducting a 'life essence extraction' on the corpse of a Dark Knight, which, thanks to some Nazi technology, succeeds.\nShortly beforeJ.\n's arrival, Zemph tries to talk the impatient Helga von Bulow out of retrieving an ancient Thulian artifact, the \"Dagger of Warding\" from a nearby altar in an isolated area of the church, but she shoots him and proceeds.\nThis final blunder awakens another monster, Olaric, which kills and dismembers her.\nBlazkowicz, after a heated battle against spirits and demon attacks, defeats Olaric, and then is airlifted out with Zemph's notes and the dagger.\nWith the lead with Helga seeming to have come to a close, the OSA begins to shift its focus to one of Germany's leading scientific researchers and Head of the SS Special Projects Division, Oberf\u00fchrer Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse.\nTheir investigation leads the OSA to realizing that Deathshead is preparing to launch an attack on London.\nHe intends to use a V-2 rocket fitted with an experimental biological warhead, launching it from his base near Katamarunde in the Baltics.\nDue to the stealthy nature in which the OSA needs to act, Blazkowicz is parachuted some distance from the missile base and separated from his equipment.\nAfter collecting his gear, he smuggles himself into a supply truck bound for the base.\nOnce inside, Blazkowicz destroys the V-2 on its launchpad and fights his way out of the facility towards an airbase filled with experimental jet aircraft.\nThere, he commandeers a \"Kobra\" rocket-plane and flies to safety in Malta.\nEager to know more about Deathshead and his secret projects, the OSA sends Blazkowicz to the bombed-out city of Kugelstadt, where he is assisted by members of the German Kreisau Circle resistance group in breaking into a ruined factory and exfiltrating a defecting scientist.\nIt is there he discovers the blueprints for the Reich's latest weapon, the Venom Gun, an electrically operated hand-held minigun.\nHe also procures the weapon itself.\nBlazkowicz eventually breaks into Deathshead's underground research complex, the Secret Weapons Facility.\nThere he encounters the horrific fruits of Deathshead's labors: creatures, malformed, and twisted through surgery and mechanical implants.\nThe creatures escape from their containments and go on a rampage.\nBlazkowicz fights his way through the facility, only to see Deathshead escape the chaos by U-Boat, and learns of his destination by interrogating a captured German officer.\nBlazkowicz, with his newly found information, is then parachuted into Norway, close to Deathshead's mysterious \"X-Labs\".\nAfter breaking into the facility, which has been overrun by the twisted creatures he encountered in Kugelstadt (dubbed 'Lopers'), Blazkowicz retrieves Deathshead's journal, its content directly linking Deathshead's research to the rest of the SS Paranormal's occult activity.\nHe then confronts several new prototype creatures called \u00dcbersoldaten (super soldiers), towering monstrosities coated in armor, powered by hydraulic legs and carrying powerful weapons.\nFinally catching up with Deathshead, Blazkowicz comes face to face with a completed and fully armored \u00dcbersoldat, and kills the researchers who have developed it.\nAfter the \u00dcbersoldat is destroyed, Deathshead shouts over the speakers in frustration and astonishment before escaping in a Kobra rocket-plane and disappears for the rest of the game.\nAfter studying the documents captured by Blazkowicz, the OSA has become aware of a scheme codenamed 'Operation: Resurrection', a plan to resurrect Heinrich I, a legendary and powerful Saxon warlock-king from 943 AD.\nDespite the skepticism of senior Allied commanders, the OSA parachutes Blazkowicz back near Castle Wolfenstein, at the Bramburg Dam, where he fights his way until he arrives at the village town of Paderborn.\nAfter assassinating all the senior officers of the SS Paranormal Division present there for the resurrection, Blazkowicz fights his way through Chateau Schufstaffel and into the grounds beyond.\nAfter fighting two more \u00dcbersoldaten, Blazkowicz enters an excavation site near Castle Wolfenstein.\nInside the excavation site, Blazkowicz fights Nazi guards and prototype \u00dcbersoldaten, and makes his way to a boarded-up entrance to Castle Wolfenstein's underground crypts.\nThere, he finds that the ruined and decaying sections of the castle has become infested with undead creatures, which are attacking the castle's desperate garrison.\nAfter fighting his way through the underworkings of the castle, Blazkowicz arrives too late at the site of a dark ceremony to prevent the resurrection of Heinrich At the ceremony, SS psychic and Oberf\u00fchrerin Marianna Blavatsky conjures up dark spirits, which transform three of Deathshead's \u00dcbersoldaten into Dark Knights, Heinrich's lieutenants.\nShe ultimately raises Heinrich I, who \"thanks\" her by turning her into his undead slave.\nIn a climactic battle, Blazkowicz, after exhausting most of his arsenal, destroys the three Dark Knights, the undead Marianna Blavatsky, and eventually Heinrich In the distance, Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler watches in horror, remarking afterwards \"This American.\nhe has ruined everything\" as he leaves for Berlin to face an expectant Hitler.\nBack in the OSA, Operation Resurrection is closed and Blazkowicz is off on some

{"prompt": "Soap opera", "completion": " The main characteristics that define soap operas are \"an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations\".\nFitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family.\nThe storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters.\n\"Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.\n'\" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from EastEnders to Dallas.\nDue to the prominence of English-language television, most soap-operas are completely English (or in the case of a foreign soap opera, dubbed into English).\nHowever, several South African soap operas started incorporating a multi-language format, the most prominent being 7de Laan, which incorporates Afrikaans, English, Zulu and several other Bantu languages which make up the 11 Official Languages of South Africa (the subtitles are always in English).\nIn many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the US, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy.\nSoap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments.\nMany of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems.\nBoth UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them.\nThis diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare.\nUK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting \"reality\" or purport to have a \"realistic\" style.\nUK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location.\nAs examples, EastEnders focuses on the tough and grim life in London's east end, while Coronation Street invokes Manchester and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of \"Northern straight talking\".\nRomance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines.\nIn US daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels.\nSoap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story.\nCrimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.\nAustralian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines.\nIn Russia, most popular serials explore the \"romantic quality\" of criminal and/or oligarch life.\nIn soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series.\nUnexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.\nAs in comic books \u2013 another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th century \u2013 a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent.\nOn The Bold and the Beautiful, Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral.\nWhen Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.\nStunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials.\nSuch story events often take place off screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown.\nThis is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing.\nWhen episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible.\nThough all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.\n"}
{"prompt": "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", "completion": " In the first episode, Starfleet Commander Benjamin Sisko arrives (along with his young son, Jake) at Deep Space Nine, a space station formerly run by the Cardassians during their oppressive occupation of Bajor, a planet which the space station orbits.\nHe is assigned to run the station jointly with the newly liberated Bajorans as they recover from the Cardassian occupation, to help pave the way for Bajor's entry into the Federation.\nSisko and Jadzia Dax stumble upon the first stable wormhole ever found and discover that it is inhabited by beings who are not bound by normal space and time.\nTo the strongly religious people of Bajor, the wormhole aliens are their gods (the Prophets) and the wormhole itself is the long-prophesied Celestial Temple, where they reside.\nSisko himself is hailed as the Emissary of the Prophets, through whom the Prophets primarily act.\nThis provides the basis for a long-lasting story arc.\nSisko initially considers his role as a religious icon with open discomfort and skepticism, referring to the Prophets simply as \"wormhole aliens\" and striving to keep his role as commander of the station distinct from any religious obligations that the Bajorans try to place on him.\nLater, he becomes more accepting of his role and, by the end of the series, he openly embraces it.\nThe political and religious implications of this on the Bajorans and its spiritual leaders (most notably, Winn Adami) also provide a central arc that lasts until the end of the series.\nThe station crew early on has to contend with a human resistance group known as the Maquis.\nRooted in the events of The Next Generation episode \"\", in which Native American settlers refuse to leave when their colony world is given to Cardassia as part of a treaty, the Maquis is an example for the show\u2019s exploration of darker themes: its members are Federation citizens who take up arms against Cardassia in defense of their homes, and some\u2014such as Calvin Hudson, a long-time friend of Sisko's, and Michael Eddington, who defects while serving aboard the station\u2014are Starfleet officers.\nThe show\u2019s sharp departure from traditional Star Trek themes can be seen in episodes such as \"\", in which Eddington complains to Sisko, \"Everybody should want to be in the Federation.\nNobody leaves paradise.\nIn some ways, you\u2019re even worse than the Borg.\nAt least they tell you about their plans for assimilation.\nYou assimilate people and they don\u2019t even know it\".\nThe Maquis also allows DS9 to subvert some longstanding Star Trek icons: Thomas Riker, a duplicate of Enterprise-D first officer Commander William Riker (also played by Jonathan Frakes; character first appeared in ST:TNGs \"\" episode), is revealed in the episode \"\" to be a member of the Maquis who gains access to the station's crew and facilities by impersonating the Enterprise's Riker.\nThe second-season episode, \"\" marks the first mention of the Dominion, a ruthless empire in the Gamma Quadrant, though they are not fully introduced until the second-season finale, \"The Jem'Hadar\".\nIt is led by \"the Founders\", a race of shape-shifting Changelings, the same species as station security chief Odo.\nThey were once persecuted by non-shape-shifters (whom they call \"Solids\") and they seek to impose \"order\" upon any who could potentially harm them, which includes nearly all Solids.\nThe Founders have created or genetically modified races to serve them: the Vorta, sly and subversive diplomats, and the Jem\u2019Hadar, their fearless shock troops.\nThese races worship the Founders as gods.\nAt the start of DS9\u2019s third season (\"\"), with the threat of a Dominion attack looming from the other side of the wormhole, Commander Sisko returns from Starfleet Headquarters on Earth with the USS Defiant, a prototype starship that was originally built to fight the Borg.\nIt remains stationed at Deep Space Nine until season seven, providing an avenue for plot lines away from the station.\nWith the third season, writers from the now completed Next Generation began to write regularly for DS9.\nThe Dominion forms an uneasy alliance with the Cardassians in the fifth-season episodes \"In Purgatory's Shadow\" and \"By Inferno's Light\" and goes to war with the other major powers of the Alpha Quadrant in the season finale \"\".\nThroughout the series, loyalties and alliances change repeatedly: pacts with the Cardassians are made, broken, and remade; a short war with the Klingons flares up and is settled, and the formerly neutral Romulans ally themselves with the Federation.\nThis last alliance is made in an attempt to turn the war around, but comes as a result of criminal and duplicitous acts on Sisko and resident Cardassian Garak's part, thus providing an example of the moral ambiguity prevalent in DS9 in comparison to the other Star Trek series.\nAnother example of DS9\u2019s darker nature is the introduction of Section 31, a secret organization dedicated to preserving the Federation way of life at any cost.\nThis shadow group, introduced in \"\", justifies its unlawful, unilateral tactics by claiming that it is essential to the continued existence of the Federation.\nSection 31 repeatedly states that if you inquire into the matter with the Federation, they will deny Section 31's existence.\nSection 31 features prominently in several episodes of the Dominion War arc, especially as it is revealed that it attempted a genocide of the Founders.\nIn DS9, the Ferengi are no longer an enemy of the Federation, but rather an economic power whose political neutrality is, for the most part, respected.\nA number of episodes explore their capitalistic nature, while others delve into the race\u2019s sexist social norms.\nUnlike their depiction in Star Trek: The Next Generation, where they were generally portrayed simply as sexist buffoons for comedic purposes, in DS9 they received a more complex depiction, with the female partner (Ishka) of the Grand Nagus leading a women's rights rebellion on the Ferengi homeworld, and Rom, Quark's brother, leading a strike against unfair working conditions in Quark's bar.\nAlso, Jake Sisko's best friend, Nog, has to deal with Starfleet's more liberal attitudes towards women while Jake learns to deal with his friend's cultural background in a respectful manner rather than risk the loss of their friendship.\nNog later decides to join Starfleet, the first Ferengi to do so.\nSeveral episodes of DS9 explore the theme of the Mirror Universe, first touched upon in the episode \"\".\nIn the second-season episode \"\", the DS9 crew first becomes aware of this alternate universe when Kira and dr Bashir experience operational difficulties while traveling through the Wormhole and wind up back on the station in the Mirror Universe dominated by the Klingon\u2013Cardassian alliance.\nThey discover that it is not DS9 to which they have returned but Terok Nor.\nBajor is not friendly and there is no Federation here.\n\"Terrans\", as they are called in this universe, are ruthless barbarians according to the Intendant (Kira's mirror self) \u2013 the Terran Empire occupied Bajor for decades much as Cardassia had in the normal universe.\nThe Klingon\u2013Cardassian alliance eventually formed and Bajor was freed from Terran occupation, later enslaving Terrans as ore miners on the orbiting space station Terok Nor.\nEnslaved as they are, the Terran workers liberate themselves and form a resistance movement, as seen in several other DS9 episodes (\"\", \"\", \"\", \"The Emperor's New Cloak\").\n"}

{"prompt": "Starship Troopers", "completion": " Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids of Klendathu.\nIt is narrated as a series of flashbacks by space marine Johnny Rico, a member of the \"Mobile Infantry\".\nThis is one of just a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion.\nThe novel opens with Rico aboard the space corvette Rodger Young (named after Medal of Honor recipient Rodger Wilton Young), serving with the platoon known as \"Rasczak's Roughnecks\" (named after the platoon leader, Lieutenant Rasczak); about to embark on a raid against a colony inhabited by \"Skinnies\" (allies of the Arachnids).\nRico himself is a 'cap [capsule] trooper' in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry.\nThe raid itself is relatively brief: the Roughnecks land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering two casualties in the process (one, Dizzy Flores, dies during the return to orbit).\nThe story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, where the reader sees his close relationship with his best friend Carl and their decision to sign up for Federal Service together over the objections of Rico's father.\nThis is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lieutenant Colonel Jean Dubois, Rico's school instructor in \"History and Moral Philosophy\"; and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a disabled recruiter for the armed forces.\nDubois elucidates the book's moral position in matters of war; whereas Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades seem primarily in contrast with Dubois.\nLater it becomes apparent that his attitude and display of truncated limbs are intended to scare off unmotivated applicants.\nInterspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's History and Moral Philosophy course, which reveal that the rights of a full Citizen (to vote and hold public office) must be earned through voluntary Federal service.\nThose who do not perform this Service retain the rights of free speech, assembly, etc, but cannot vote or hold public office.\nThis structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the \"20th century Western democracies\", brought on by social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas.\nIn the next section of the novel, Rico begins training at Camp Arthur Currie on the Canadian prairie.\nFive chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience there, under the tutelage of career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim.\nFewer than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training; the rest resign, are expelled, or die in training.\nOne of the chapters displays Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer, who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer (Sergeant Zim) during a simulated combat exercise.\nZim does not offer this information to his superior, but Hendrick does.\nAnother recruit, a deserter who murdered a baby girl while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police.\nRico himself is flogged for negligent handling of his equipment during a simulated nuclear weapons drill.\nDespite this punishment and his own earlier doubts about his fitness to serve, Rico eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in the Fleet.\nDuring Rico's training, the \"Bug War\" has changed from border incidents to a full-scale war, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations.\nThe war \"officially\" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires (which kills Rico's mother).\nRico briefly describes the Terran Federation's disastrous defeat at the Battle of Klendathu, during which his first unit and ship are destroyed.\nFollowing Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to hit-and-run raids similar to that described at the beginning of the novel.\nThis part of the book describes the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers (personified in this case by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal).\nEventually, Rico becomes a career soldier, and one of his fellow troopers recommends him to Officer Candidate School, where he undergoes a second course of training.\nEn route from the Roughnecks to OCS, Sergeant Rico encounters his estranged father, now Corporal Rico, in transit, and reconciles with him.\nSergeant Rico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit.\nUnder the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, Zim (reassigned from Camp Arthur Currie), Rico commands a platoon during 'Operation Royalty': a raid to capture members of the Bugs' 'brain caste' and 'queens', and graduates as a second lieutenant.\nThe final chapter serves as a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the commander of Rico's Roughnecks (previously Rasczak's Roughnecks), preparing to invade Klendathu, with his father as senior NCO.\n"}

{"prompt": "The Time Machine", "completion": " The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, in Victorian England, and identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller.\nThe narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it.\nHe reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him toD.\n802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults.\nThey live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet.\nHis efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing, and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx.\nLuckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them).\nLater in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night.\nWithin their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible.\nHe alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks.\nDeducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi.\nHis revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants, but of livestock and ranchers.\nThe Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.\nMeanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days.\nHe takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine.\nHe plans to take Weena back to his own time.\nBecause the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints.\nThe Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape.\nHe reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time.\nThere he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation.\nHe continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.\nOverwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three hours after he originally left.\nInterrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket.\nThe original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey.\nAfter promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.\n"}

{"prompt": "The Breakfast Club", "completion": " On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students report at 7:00&nbsp;am.\nfor all-day detention at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois.\nWhile not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish, the state champion wrestler Andrew Clark, the bookish Brian Johnson, the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds, and the rebellious delinquent John Bender.\nThey gather in the high school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00&nbsp;pm.\nHe assigns them a 1,000-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are\".\nHe then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.\nBender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students, teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire.\nAllison is initially quiet, except for an occasional random outburst.\nOver the course of the day, Vernon gives Bender several weekends' worth of additional detention and even locks him in a storage closet, but he escapes and returns to the library.\nThe students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker.\nGradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; Bender comes from an abusive household; Brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends.\nThey also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; Bender's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments.\nThe students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.\nDespite their differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses.\nClaire gives Allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in Andrew.\nClaire decides to break her \"pristine\" virgin appearance by kissing Bender in the closet and giving him a hickey.\nAlthough they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers afterwards.\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left.\nBrian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave.\nAs the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and Bender.\nAllison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe.\nVernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes.\nOne by one, the five students' voices add, \"But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal\".\nBrian signs the letter as \"The Breakfast Club\".\nBender raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home.\n"}
{"prompt": "The Shockwave Rider", "completion": " Based on the ideas in the book Future Shock by Alvin Toffler, the novel shows a dystopian early 21st century America dominated by computer networks, and is considered by some critics to be an early ancestor of the \"cyberpunk\" genre.\nThe hero, Nick Haflinger, is a runaway from Tarnover, a government program intended to find, educate and indoctrinate highly gifted children to further the interests of the state in a future where quantitative analysis backed by the tacit threat of coercion has replaced overt military and economic power as the deciding factor in international competition.\nIn parallel with this, the government has become a de facto oligarchy whose beneficiaries are members of organised crime.\nNick's talent extends to programming the network using only a touch tone telephone.\nOne of his handlers at Tarnover explains that this is like a classical pianist being able to play entire sonatas and concertos from memory.\nHowever Nick also has some personality flaws, amounting almost to a deathwish.\nThese become manifest in exhibitions of his abilities, revealing his identity to his pursuers.\nThe background to the story includes a massive earthquake laying waste to the San Francisco Bay Area in California.\nMillions die and millions more are left to live on government handouts.\nThe subsequent economic depression, coupled with the rootlessness enabled by access to online data and strong social pressure to be flexible (the results of corporations wanting highly mobile workforces without strong local ties), results in a fragmentation of society along religious, ethnic and a variety of class markers, what Toffler calls \"subcults\", including what would in 2010 be described as \"gangs\".\nThe equitable distribution of data access and data privacy is a prominent theme in the book; characters who have access to information which is nominally secret enjoy demonstrable economic advantages over others lacking access to such data.\nIn the novel, data privacy is reserved for corporate entities and individuals who may then conceal wrongdoing; by contrast, normal citizens do not enjoy significant privacy.\nThe world described in the book is dystopian, with laissez-faire economics portrayed as leading inevitably to disaster as greed trumps long-term planning.\nThe educational system is dysfunctional, with teachers unable to perform their jobs due to strictures.\nThe only 'functional' educational system seen in the book is portrayed as an enclave, the tightly-controlled Tarnover school.\nCommunities are either walled enclaves of privilege or largely lawless areas entirely lacking protection from corrupt civil authorities.\nInfrastructure has been allowed to crumble, and characters who reside within 'paid avoidance zones' receive compensation from the government in lieu of actual services.\nThe novel is set in the weeks following Nick's recapture after several years on the run, alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator, who is trying to discover why the program's star pupil had absconded, and flashbacks of his career.\nThe interrogator is Paul Freeman, a graduate of another secret installation known as \"Electric Skillet\", which focuses on weapons and defence strategy.\nAlthough he had initially felt at home at Tarnover, Nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there.\nThese produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study.\nAt this point Nick becomes determined to escape.\nHe studies data processing, steals a personal ID code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance, and goes on the run.\nHe uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself, easily adopting entire new personas.\nOne is the pastor of a popular church, another is a successful computer consultant.\nIn this last role, calling himself Sandy Locke, he becomes the lover of Ina Grierson, a top executive at Ground to Space Industries, a powerful \"hypercorp\" known to all as G2S.\nIntending to use the computer facilities at G2S to ensure that his stolen code is still valid, he signs on as a \"systems rationalizer\" with the company.\nThis brings him into contact with Ina's daughter, Kate, who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle.\nAt the age of 22, Nick's age when he left Tarnover, Kate is a perpetual student at \"UMKC\".\nShe is perceptive enough to penetrate Nick's adopted persona, deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him.\nHe visits her at home, helping her to clean out some of her possessions, and meeting her tame cougar, Bagheera.\nBagheera is the product of her late father's genetic research into intelligence.\nHe died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses.\nThe 21st-century lifestyle produces a symptom called \"overload\" in many people, and most, including Nick, take tranquilizers to some degree.\nHowever Nick collapses completely when told that a representative from Tarnover is coming to meet him at G2S.\nHe returns to Kate and confesses that he is not what he seems, asking for her help.\nShe conducts him to one of the \"paid avoidance areas\" in California, where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology, as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake.\nAfter Nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places, they move to the least known one, a town called Precipice.\nPrecipice turns out to be a Utopian community of a few thousand people.\nThe nearest comparison would be an agrarian, cottage industry community designed by William Morris.\nPrecipice is also the home of \"Hearing Aid\", an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country.\nHearing Aid is also known as the \"Ten Nines\", after the phone number used to call it: 999-999-9999.\nPeople call the service, a human operator answers, and they simply talk while the operator listens.\nSome rant, others seek sympathy, still others commit suicide while on the phone.\nHearing Aid's promise is that nobody else, not even the government, will hear the call.\nThe only response Hearing Aid gives to a caller is \"Only I heard that, I hope it helped\".\nNick and Kate settle into the community.\nThe inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that Kate's father worked on.\nThese act as companions, guards, nannies, and even lie detectors, using their sense of smell.\nNick rewrites the \"computer tapeworm\" that prevents the calls to Hearing Aid being monitored.\nWhile at G2S he became aware of massive backups of data being performed, clearly in anticipation of a major network outage.\nThe Hearing Aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked, but Nick realises that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them.\nHis new worm, which he calls a \"phage\", cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network.\nPossibly encouraged by the government, local gangs and tribes raid Precipice, burning down Nick and Kate's house before being overwhelmed by the dogs.\nNick, suffering another overload, blames Kate for the incident, since she, following Hearing Aid policy, cut off a call from someone attempting to warn Precipice.\nHe hits her, and then, filled with remorse, leaves the town.\nHe finally reveals his location to the authorities when, encountering one of the \"Roman circus\" operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country, he responds to an \"all comers\" challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs, and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience.\nAt Tarnover, Paul Freeman takes charge of the interrogation.\nHe was the representative whom Nick, as Sandy Locke, was supposed to meet at G2S.\nFreeman, a tall gaunt African-American, gradually comes to realise that he has more sympathy with Nick's views than his employer's, and eventually absconds himself, giving Nick computer access so that Nick can make his own escape.\nThe precipitating event in this case is Kate's abduction by government agents, who bring her to Tarnover for further questioning and to threaten Nick.\nWith the code he gets from Freeman, he sets up an identity as an Army major, with Kate as his prisoner.\nOnce clear of Tarnover, they disappear together.\nThis time around, Nick has another plan, and rather than running and hiding, he and Kate spend a number of months travelling the country, aided by an \"invisible college\" of academics who are allies or former residents of Precipice.\nHe creates a new \"worm\" which is designed to destroy all secrecy.\n(Brunner invented the term \"worm\" for this program, as a self-replicating program that propagates across a computer network \u2013 the term \"worm\" was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program)  The worm is eventually activated, and the details of all the government's dark secrets (clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children, bribes and kickbacks from corporations, concealed crimes of high public officials) now become accessible from anywhere on the network \u2013 in fact, those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details.\nIn place of the old system, Nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism, with people's worth being defined by their roles in society, not their connections in high places.\nIn effect, the network becomes the entire government and financial system, policing income for illegal money, freezing the accounts of criminals, while making sure money (or credit) flows to places where people are in need.\nThis will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite, again conducted over the network, allow it.\nIn a final atavistic attempt at revenge, the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local Air Force base.\nWarned by Hearing Aid, Nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter-order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town.\nThe book ends optimistically, with there being no more privileged hiding of information, no more secret conspiracies of the rich and powerful.\n"}
