# AIRC-ASR-Experimental

Through this research project, we plan to
develop novel improvements to existing NLP and ASR models
through optimization and experimentation.  This is the experimental 
version of the project mostly used for protoyping different ideas.

We have read many contemporary papers to better inform ourselves 
as to which techniques to explore and how to best implement them.
